A bicycle with a giant set of light up cat's whiskers if the latest gadget aiming to make cyclist's lives safer. They can be used to warn other road users a cyclist is approaching, let drivers know exactly how much space is needed, and even twitch to indicate a turn. Scroll down for video . The life-saving whiskers: The strands of smart material can extend to mark space, and twitch when the user wants to turn . The four whiskers can change their configuration, allowing the cyclists to signal their intentions. Controlled by a button on the handlebars, the four long whiskers on the Vibrasee can flick fully outward, discouraging a car from squeezing by. Reflective stripes make each whisker stand out even more. When a cyclist wants to turn, they can flick the whiskers on one side in the right direction and flash lights inside as a signal. Called VibriSee, the whiskers were invented by students at California State University-Long Beach. 'When you’re in the middle of the street with cars, what tends to happen is drivers see the space around you and they’ll attempt to pass,' Channing Shattuck, who worked on the design for the Vibrasee with five fellow students, told Fastco. 'It’s dangerous for the cyclist, and dangerous for the car if there’s oncoming traffic. But what if we could expand the bike to look bigger, so cars don't try to go around?' The four whiskers can change their configuration, allowing the cyclists to signal their intentions. Controlled by a button on the handlebars, the four long whiskers on the Vibrasee can flick fully outward, discouraging a car from squeezing by. Reflective stripes make each whisker stand out even more. When a cyclist wants to turn, they can flick the whiskers on one side in the right direction and flash lights inside as a signal. The whiskers can glow at night, and when they are needed to act as turn indicators . 'Cycling as a form of transportation is a growing alternative to fossil-fuel powered vehicles, but as cycling grows more popular each year, cities like Long Beach are implementing initiatives to develop their infrastructure in order to accommodate this exploding demographic,' the students wrote. 'By interviewing various members of the Long Beach bicycle community, we were able to determine three main concerns: communication of a bicyclist’s intentions, increased visibility both day & night, and proper allocation of space when sharing the road.' The team then spent time at zoos and animal parks to look at how nature approached the problem. 'By visiting various biomes within our city and with the help of university biologists, we identified several animals that have evolved attributes with the potential to solve these concerns - namely peacocks, ctenophores, and rodents. 'Using their unique traits, we designed VibriSee, a mountable bicycle accessory that sports flexible, illuminated whiskers. 'These luminescent tendrils provide the user with several opportunities,' the researchers say. 'First, they exponentially increase visibility of the cyclists both day and night through a combination of both fluorescent bands and stripes of emitted light. 'Second, these four whiskers can change their configuration, allowing the cyclists to signal their intentions. 'Finally, VibriSee empowers the cyclist with the ability to indicate their spatial zone by flaring their whiskers and flashing warning colors.' The project was part of the Biomimicry Student Design Challenge, which asked design students to take inspiration from local ecology to tackle a transportation issue.\",\n",

A popular New Jersey teacher has been dismissed for streaking around his apartment block. Mark Bringhurst, 40, was named 2011-12 teacher of the year at Winslow Elementary School, where he had been a fifth-grade teacher for the last eight years. But police charged Bringhurst for making a naked dash in March and, under new employment laws, he was sacked for acting 'in an improper manner.' On a streak: Mark Bringhurst (left), 2011-12 teacher of the year, lost his job for running naked through the parking lot at Greenwich Village Apartments (right) The Daily Journal reports that officers were called to Greenway Village Apartments in West Berlin, New Jersey, on the evening of March 21. A witness had complained that a naked man was running through the parking lot and he was worried about the safety of children in the area. The caller also stated that this wasn't the first time that the same nude man had sprinted through the apartment complex. The police tracked Bringhurst down to his car in the parking lot of an adult bookstore. At first he denied the charge, then admitted he had done it as a dare. The teacher apologized and said he had never intended anyone to see him. When the teacher asked to be reinstated in his job it initiated a battle between Bringhurst and the school district. Bringhurst did not dispute the facts of the incident, but claimed he was cooperative with the investigation, that he had sought help immediately after his arrest and that he was no longer in contact with the person that set the dare in the first place. In August, the Board of Education members voted for Bringhurst's dismissal and his sacking was made public earlier in December. This case is the first to use a new tenure law that is designed to reduce the amount of time it takes to resolve such disputes. School arbitrator Robert C Gifford wrote that Bringhurst 'exercised severely poor judgment on more than one occasion. His lack of judgment is not diminished by the fact that his conduct occurred outside the school setting.' School Superintendent Mary Gruccio claimed the district demanded his dismissal because 'his behavior cannot be tolerated by the Vineland public school district,' reported the Daily Journal. On their website the apartment block that Bringhurst streaked through claims: 'Greenway Village Apartments offers a relaxing atmosphere that allows you a peaceful alternative to your hectic, daily schedule. 'No matter how stressful your day may be, the serene surroundings of our community will show you how enjoyable it is to come home.' This article previously included an image of a person who was misidentified as Mark Bringhurst. Scene of the crime: Bringhurst streaked around this apartment block on more than one occasion .\",\n",

Fitness instructor Lisa Bratt, 40, collapsed when she suffered a bleed on the brain and a stroke after years of unexplained headaches. Hospital tests revealed her brain was unresponsive so her husband Paul, 38, made the decision to allow doctors to remove her organs. Lisa Bratt (pictured on her wedding day with her husband, Paul) died after collapsing suddenly with a brain haemorrhage and a stroke after suffering from headaches . Part of her liver was donated to a three-year-old boy - allowing him home for the Christmas - and her heart saved the life of a 40-year-old woman from Glasgow. Her lungs, kidneys and the other half of her liver went to save the lives of four more people in Newcastle, Leeds and Liverpool. Mr Bratt, from Hartlepool, said: ‘When I got there she had already gone. I knew that. ‘I had a little bit of hope, but doctors warned me even if she had come through she wouldn't have remembered her life. Mr Bratt agreed to allow his wife's organs to be donated and they have saved six people's lives. The couple are pictured with their sons Michael, 10, and Joshua, nine . ‘I never left her bedside, it was horrible. I'm extremely proud Lisa was able to help others - it's a good thing. ‘Lisa was kind, loving, happy-go-lucky and would do anything for anybody. A brain haemorrhage is bleeding in or around the brain. It can be caused by a head injury but can also happen spontaneously as a result of a ruptured aneurysm. Symptoms include a sudden, very severe headache, vomiting, fits, loss of consciousness and sudden death. A brain haemorrhage is a medical emergency which requires immediate treatment. The two treatment options are using medication to prevent further bleeding, and surgery to repair the source of the bleeding. Haemorrhages most often occur as the result of a brain aneurysm bursting - a brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel's wall. People who smoke, drink heavily, have poorly controlled high blood pressure or who have a family history of aneurysms are most at risk. About 65 per cent of brain haemorrhage patients survive but many find their recovery slow and frustrating. About 9,000 people in the UK have a brain haemorrhage every year. Four out of five patients are aged between 40 and 65. They are more common in women than men. Source: NHS Choices . ‘When we found out she had helped that . little boy go home for Christmas it was overwhelming - I'm tearing up . just thinking about it. ‘She will be there looking down over us . knowing she has helped all these people. That was Lisa - she would do . anything for anyone.’ The newly-qualified fitness trainer was . driving home after dropping her husband off at a work training course . when she was forced to pull over due to an overwhelming headache on . November 18 last year. Screaming in pain, she ran to a nearby friend's house where she collapsed, suffering a bleed on her brain at the same time as a stroke. An ambulance took her to the University Hospital of North Tees, in Stockton, but medics could not bring her back. She was kept clinically alive while doctors took her organs, before pronouncing her dead on November 19. Mr Bratt faced the task of breaking the news to their children - Natasha, 21, Michael, 10, and nine-year-old Joshua. The off-shore platform inspector said: ‘The hardest part was when the boys came in from school on the Tuesday and having to tell them. ‘The boys have taken it all okay and Natasha is doing well at the moment. ‘I have loads of family support and people I work with out in Africa have also come to see me - I've been overwhelmed. ‘She was the best mum the kids could ever wish for, she was the best wife, and she doted on her nephews.’ Mr Bratt will get more details of who his wife helped - and maybe even thank you letters - in the coming year. He also hopes to find out more about why she suddenly collapsed. Part of Mrs Bratt's liver was used to save the life of a three-year-old boy and receiving it enabled him to go home from hospital for Christmas . ‘She was so fit,’ he said. ‘She had just qualified as a fitness instructor, went to the gym every other day and even had a six-pack - she had never been fitter.’ Mrs Bratt’s mother Denise Novak, 60, paid tribute to her eldest child.

Mr Malloy, of Malloy Aeronautics, . explained: 'When I first got my helicopter licence I realised the . helicopter as a design needs a lot of improvements to be made.' Wanting . to increase reliability and safety, he added: 'Where we strip away . complexity and increase safety, that's where the hoverbike comes from.' The full sized design uses a motorcycle engine and controls. However, the smaller version uses electric motors, and can be controlled using a standard RC helicopter controller.

Senior inspector Audrey Gunn said: 'The lady was shocked when I told her it wasn’t a real iguana as she thought she’d seen it blink. 'I think someone must have nailed the toy to the tree as a joke and I can see why it fooled her.' The 'iguana' has been taken in by Ms Gunn’s colleague Mandy McIntyre, a reptile enthusiast who works for the charity. The soft toy iguana, which has now been removed, was spotted on a tree near Thurso, Caithness in Scotland . She said: 'It was a nice surprise to find there wasn’t an animal in danger in this case and I must admit it gave Mandy and I a bit of a giggle. 'Although this incident turned out to be a false alarm, we’d always encourage people to give us a call if they think an animal is in need of help.'\",\n",

Now the world's 'most resilient screen protector' has gone on sale, capable of surviving being hit by a hammer. During tests, the transparent screen, which is the same thickness as three pieces of paper, also remained undamaged when dropped while walking on tarmac, bricks and concrete, its manufacturer claims. Called Rhino Shield, the protector is made from a custom-formulated polymer and can absorb five times the impact energy of Gorilla Glass - the glass currently used on iPhone and Samsung screens, for example. Scroll down for video . The Rhino Shield screen protector, pictured here on the iPhone 5, costs £17.99 and can absorb up to five times the force of Gorilla Glass, currently used on iPhones and other phones. During tests it was also able to withstand being dropped on bricks and tarmac . Even a 255g steel ball dropping from 48cm failed to scratch the screen and left the phone 'fully usable.' Made by Cambridge-based Evolutive Labs, the sheet can be fitted to the iPhone 5, 5S and 5C and does not affect the touchscreen's sensitivity. The screen comes with a self-adhesive silicone back and as the user wipes a cloth along the front of the film, it clings to the phone's screen, but can be removed if necessary. Its makers claim the Rhino Shield leaves 'no sticky residue or air bubbles' and uses what's called an oleophobic coating that makes it 'smudge proof'; meaning fingerprints don't stick to it. An iPhone 4 version of the scratch resistant screen will be available soon, with other models expected in the future. Rhino Shield was funded by a Kickstarter campaign that ended in March this year and it is now on sale from Firebox for £17.99. The makers explained on the campaign page: 'Protecting mobile devices have been a big challenge. The Rhino Shield sheet, pictured, is the same thickness as three pieces of paper, around 0.029cm, and has a 95 per cent transparency rating. Its makers Evolutive Labs claim that it doesn't affect the phone's touchscreen . The Rhino Shield also comes with an oleophobic coating making it resistant to smudges and fingerprints . 'There are many great cases that already tackle some of the problems with outstanding solutions and we have seen some protection at insane levels, i.e. cases that enable smart devices to survive when a car runs over it. 'However, there are very few products that attempt to protect the most vulnerable part of the phone - its screen. 'Therefore we were determined to design and engineer a screen protector that will be resistant to impacts. After a year of relentless research and development, the end product is Rhino Shield.' The phone protector goes on sale as SquareTrade, a provider of protection plans for gadgets, tested five smartphones, including Apple's new iPhones, to see if they could withstand drops, dunks and other common hazards. Its found that while the iPhone 5C and 5S scored similar on the 'Breakability' scale, the latest models aren't as durable as last year's iPhone 5. The biggest loser, however, was Samsung's Galaxy S4, which failed to work after being submerged in water and being dropped 5 feet off the ground, according to San Francisco-based SquareTrade. The phone that withstood SquareTrade's torture test best was Google's Moto X. New research by SquareTrade reveals that the iPhone 5s & 5c were outshone by their predecessor, the iPhone 5, and the Samsung Galaxy S4.\",\n",

A Utah judge appointed Jeffs to control the estate while he decides a will dispute between ex-wife Shannon Price and former business associate Anna Gray. Coleman divorced Price in 2008, but they were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered a fall at home last month and died two days later of a brain hemorrhage at the Provo, Utah, hospital.

In addition they have also been told not to approach Bolt or any other athletes for 'selfies' with the competition near to a close. One volunteer at Hampden told the Evening Standard that this wasn't the first-time that Bolt had been approached by staff asking for a picture with him. 'The [supervisor] was saying we shouldn’t be doing that with out mobile phones,' the volunteer said. 'Everyone was taking photographs of him but these two guys got punted [sacked].' Bolt, the double 100m, 200m and 4x100m Olympic champion, arrived in Glasgow on Saturday but was thought not to have played any part in the three security guards' dismissal.

Yet Dylan Thomas could get the ladies into bed, all right — even though he wasn’t much good under the covers. Thomas was as faithful as a randy rabbit, but he wooed women with a shower of sensual, shimmering words that fell on the parched earth of their souls. The love of his life was as destructive and damaged as he was, and though others tried to save him from himself, the writer was doomed to die at 39, after a (disputed) mammoth drinking session in New York. Randy rabbit: Dylan Thomas was constantly unfaithful, but wooed women with a shower of sensual, shimmering words . Six decades after his death, Dylan Thomas is creeping back into fashion. But the superb rolling music of his lines isn’t to everybody’s taste; some prefer their poetry crisper, sharper, cooler. The trouble is that there have been many, many accounts of his shambolic, sponging, drunken life — and the more you read, the harder it is to separate the petulant, self-indulgent, overgrown child from the glorious bard, who is surely one of the most interesting voices of the last century. Hilly Janes paints a largely sympathetic portrait of the poet, which is fitting, since her unique ‘way in’ is through the eyes of her own father, the distinguished painter Fred Janes. He completed three portraits of his lifelong friend — and these (pictured on the book jacket) give Hilly Janes her loose structure: the ‘three lives’. What makes this book so readable is the fact that it offers rather more than Dylan Thomas and his insalubrious escapades. Portrait of a poet: Dylan Thomas by his friend, painter Fred Janes . Janes creates an affectionate group-memoir of a creative set of young Welshman — Thomas, Fred Janes, Vernon Watkins, Mervyn Levy and Dan Jones — who left the land of their fathers to make their way in the world, painting, writing and making music. There are some lovely stories. When the painter and the poet were sharing a chaotic flat in London, Fred was in charge of the rent, ‘and while Dylan only had a mattress to sleep on, if he didn’t pay his share, Fred, who was much taller and stronger, would pick him up, turn him upside down and shake him till any loose change fell out of his trouser\\xa0pockets’. Dylan’s nastier side displayed itself very early. He was used to being molly-coddled by his too-devoted mother Florence and hated having to fend for himself. So he wrote to a Swansea friend ‘complaining about the “little maggots” he was living with and how boring and provincial he found them’. Nowhere in her book does Hilly Janes indicate that her father was anything other than a good friend to the often-disgusting Dylan — and, indeed, after the poet’s premature death, Fred was very caring and attentive to Florence. In 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara, who had been neglected by appalling parents and raped by the artist Augustus John. She was to match Thomas in alcoholism and promiscuity, and expressed her rage and frustration at his dissolute, irresponsible life by physically attacking him. She was a pretty dreadful mother, by all accounts, and her own children knew the feel of her fists. On the other hand, Hilly Janes comments that it’s hard not to empathise with the hard-pressed woman who said: ‘Had I not gone to the pub with Dylan I would have been left there, sitting like a fool.’ Unlikely lothario: Despite being pasty-faced, overweight and constantly smelling of booze, Thomas (played by Tom Hollander) could get ladies into bed . The author is at pains to remind us of Thomas’s quieter, gentler side, too, and brings us up to date with what happened after his death: the long struggles over his inheritance and what became of children and grandchildren. Her analysis of his literary legacy is deft, but almost the most delightful thing about this book is its tribute to her talented father, who died in 1999 and was clearly a man of integrity. Which, I’m afraid, nobody could say of Dylan Thomas.',\n",

Known for his pasty complexion, overweight frame, and constant smell of alcohol and tobacco, Thomas was nonetheless a charismatic figure who could charm women with his poetic words. His relationship with Caitlin Macnamara, his wife, was as destructive as it was passionate, marked by mutual alcoholism and promiscuity. Despite his numerous infidelities and irresponsible behavior, Thomas's literary genius is undeniable, and his work continues to influence and divide opinion six decades after his death at the age of 39.\\n\\nHilly Janes's book offers a sympathetic and multifaceted portrait of Thomas, drawing on her father Fred Janes's lifelong friendship with the poet. Fred, a distinguished painter, completed three portraits of Thomas, which serve as the structure for the book. The narrative extends beyond Thomas's personal life, providing a group memoir of a creative set of young Welshmen, including poets and artists, who left their homeland to pursue their dreams.

The answer is 84 people - and a monkey and a snake - from eleven different countries, according to a filmmaker who took the puzzle on a trip around the world. Nuseir Yassin set off on the trip after graduating from Harvard in economics in May, but he decided to take a bit of light entertainment with him - in the form of a Rubik\\'s cube. For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to one colour. In order to allow people from all over the world to take part and decipher the code, Nuseir planned the moves beforehand. He then asked people in each country to complete a single move under his instruction while he filmed them with his iPhone. Nuseir also included some brilliant footage of a monkey playing with the cube and a snake slithering past. \\'When I asked people to do their move, I told them which move they have to take,\\' Yassin explained to The Huffington Post. \\'It\\'s basically impossible to have people know what move to make if you just hand them a Rubik\\'s Cube and say \"go\".\\' Monkey business: Nuseir Yassin gave this Rubik\\'s cube to the mammal to see if it would make the right move .

Batman link: The Twitter link went through to this webpage . \\'Admittedly some people might have been thrown off by the headline,\\' said Vatican communications adviser Greg Burke. The tweet went through to the website of . the Pontifical Council . for Social Communications which was running at story with the headline . \\'Holy Switcheroo: Batman has grown bitter, more vengeful with . the years.\\' Monsignor Paul Tighe, the No. 2 in the Vatican\\'s social communications office, said the office\\'s website, runs stories about communications issues and regularly takes copy from Catholic News Service, the news agency of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Once a story is posted, he explained, it generates an automatic tweet on the office\\'s Twitter handle (at)pccs_va. \\'I thought we had been hacked to be honest,\\' he said.

Earlier this week, the Twitter account of a senior Vatican official was hacked. Meanwhile today . Pope Francis called for more dialogue with Islam and offered an . olive branch to China and other countries that don\\'t have diplomatic . relations with the Holy See. Strong words: Francis said it was important to intensify dialogue among different religions \\'particularly dialogue with Islam\\' Vision: The Pope advocated more interaction between different faiths as a means of promoting peace . Delivery: In his first foreign policy address as pope, Francis delivered his remarks in Italian rather than the traditional French . In his first foreign policy address as pope, Francis delivered his remarks in Italian rather than the traditional French - another indication that the Argentine-born pope is less than comfortable speaking languages other than Italian and his mother-tongue Spanish. The occasion was an audience with ambassadors from the 180 countries that have diplomatic relations with the Holy See, in which Francis explained he would work for peace, the poor and to \"build bridges\" between peoples. He noted that even his title \"pontiff\" means bridge-builder. Francis said it was important to intensify dialogue among different religions \"particularly dialogue with Islam\" and to deepen the church\\'s outreach to atheists. Co-operation: The Vatican said that Al-Azhar\\'s chief imam, Sheik Ahmed el-Tayyib, sent a message of congratulations to Francis for his election and hoped for cooperation . Greeting: Pope Francis greets Francesco Maria Greco Italian ambassador today . The Vatican\\'s relations with Islam hit several bumps during Pope Benedict XVI\\'s papacy: He outraged Muslims with a 2006 speech quoting a Byzantine emperor as saying some of the Prophet Muhammad\\'s teachings were \\'evil and inhuman.\\' And in 2011, the pre-eminent institute of Islamic learning in the Sunni Muslim world, Cairo\\'s Al-Azhar institute, froze dialogue with the Vatican to protest Benedict\\'s call for greater protection of Christians in Egypt. However, the Vatican said Friday that Al-Azhar\\'s chief imam, Sheik Ahmed el-Tayyib, sent a message of congratulations to Francis for his election and hoped for cooperation. That\\'s a possible sign of a thaw in relations with the arrival of a pope whose interfaith outreach while archbishop of Buenos Aires has been well-documented. Future: Francis also said he wanted to begin a \\'journey\\' with countries that don\\'t yet have diplomatic relations with the Vatican . Jovial: Pope Francis smiles as he greets foreign diplomats today . Respect: Pope Francis welcomes the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I during a private audience at the Vatican . History: Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was the first patriarch of Constantinople to attend a papal inauguration since 1054 when the eastern and western halves of Christendom split in the so-called \\'Great Schism\\' Francis also said he wanted to begin a \\'journey\\' with countries that don\\'t yet have diplomatic relations with the Vatican. Benedict had made improving relations with China a priority, given the millions of faithful who belong to China\\'s underground Catholic Church, but tensions remain particularly over the appointment of bishops. China insists on naming them, while the Vatican says only the pope can name bishops. China congratulated Francis for his election but said establishing formal relations would depend on the Vatican cutting diplomatic ties with Taiwan and ceasing activities Beijing considers as interference in its internal affairs - a reference to bishops\\' appointments.

              "  {'content': \"A rare thing happened at Old Trafford on Saturday: Radamel Falcao won the game for Manchester United. It was an isolated moment of class in a game of unremitting drudgery. In fact, it was just about the only moment of class. Ander Herrera played a ball into the box from the United right midway through the second half and Falcao took it down with the sweetest of touches. In the same movement, the Colombian spun away from Sunderland’s John O’Shea and was pulled back as he shaped to shoot. Radamel Falcao goes down under the challenge of John O'Shea and Wes Brown to win a penalty . Falcao's touch which led to the penalty was a reminder of his quality, and changed the course of the game . Brown was sent off for his part in bringing down the Colombian, but it should have been O'Shea . Wayne Rooney stepped up to convert the penalty, putting United into the lead at Old Trafford . Referee Roger East sent off Wes Brown by mistake, Wayne Rooney scored the resultant penalty and the game was effectively over. It was a tantalising glimpse of the player Falcao used to be, Atletico Madrid’s feared penalty-box predator who could terrorise the best defences. A few seconds later, he was substituted for Marouane Fellaini. A thunderclap of boos rolled around the stadium in protest. In many ways, it was hard to argue with manager Louis van Gaal’s decision. Falcao was lucky he had lasted that long. His £60 million team-mate, Angel di Maria, had been taken off at half-time after an anonymous first half. Before the crucial penalty Falcao had been ineffectual, failing to find the form that brought him to Old Trafford . Falcao has not done enough to convince Louis van Gaal he should be signed permanently this summer . Angel di Maria was also off the pace in United's 2-0 win over Sunderland and was replaced at half time . Van Gaal insisted that Di Maria still needs time to adapt, but he should apply the same principle to Falcao . There were no complaints about that and the truth is that Falcao, 29, had been very much Di Maria’s equal in mediocrity. Most of the time, his second touch was a tackle. It’s an old saying but it rang true for Falcao in the opening 45 minutes. The ball kept bouncing off him. ‘I was very pleased with his action for the penalty because he won it for us,’ said Van Gaal. ‘But I had to win the game and I saw at that moment that we needed to keep the ball more and with Fellaini it is more easy to keep the ball.’ Once again on Saturday, Falcao’s former knack of poaching goals from nowhere appeared, once again, to have deserted him. Sure, the service he received was hardly up to the standard that United forwards of the past have been used to. Falcao looks on disappointed as another United chance goes begging, while Rooney bends over . The Colombian striker has become more notable for missing chances than scoring them since joining United . Falcao's goals have been few and far between, but his match-winning touch showed he has still got it . But on the few occasions that Ashley Young, United’s liveliest forward, did force his way to the byline and cut back crosses, Falcao was out of the picture. In that first half, he was marked out of the game by former United defender Brown, who didn’t give him a kick. Brown is a good player but he’s not exactly Thiago Silva. In the circumstances, Falcao was lucky to make it back out for the second half. He has scored just four goals in 17 league appearances for Manchester United this season. His threat has been negligible. The consensus is that time is running out for him to persuade Van Gaal and the rest of the United hierarchy that it would be responsible for them to spend the £40m to make his loan deal from Monaco permanent at the end of the season. Falcao, once so dynamic a poacher in the penalty area, was rarely in the right place at the right time . The striker continued to work hard throughout, but until the penalty showed very little quality . The 29-year-old applauds the Manchester United fans, who have stuck by him through his form troubles . However wonderful a striker Falcao used to be, the hard truth is that on the basis of what United have seen so far, if they had to make their decision today, he is simply not worth it. And yet having invested so much in him emotionally, having hailed him as a goalscoring hero when he arrived in the summer, United’s supporters are reluctant to give up on him just yet. To their credit, they have been relentlessly supportive of Falcao. Their yearning for him to rediscover his quality has never curdled into disillusionment. And to Falcao’s credit, he has never stopped working. That is part of the reason United fans have stuck by him. If Di Maria has developed a tendency to drift aimlessly through games, Falcao has never stopped running himself into the ground. Falcao shakes hands with United staff members after being replaced on the hour-mark on Saturday . Marouane Fellaini was brought on by Van Gaal to help United retain possession better once in the lead . And while he is still capable of producing a moment of magic like Saturday's pivotal moment, there will still be those who will dream he can return to his former self. In those circumstances, might Van Gaal have kept Falcao on the pitch for a while to see if he could capitalise on the confidence that winning that penalty had brought him? If there is even a slim chance of bringing a player of his pedigree back to life, then surely it is worth taking. Van Gaal had said on Friday that the reason United are not challenging for the title is that they do not have a 20-goal-a-season striker. But Falcao was brought to the club to be that striker. Resurrect him and United’s chances of making the top four and securing a place in the Champions League next season will improve dramatically. Falcao celebrates with Rooney, and could yet prove to be important in Manchester United's push for Europe . If Van Gaal can help his forward to find confidence, he could have the striker he thought he had signed . Instead, the chance to breathe confidence back into him was missed and when the final whistle blew, Falcao walked alone along the touchline, applauded all the way by the home supporters. Many saw Van Gaal’s decision to substitute him as a sign that he has already made up his mind to let him go. But when the United boss spoke about Di Maria afterwards, he was at pains to point out that it takes time to settle in the Premier League. The same logic applies to Falcao, maybe even more so given that he is still recovering from a serious knee injury that ruled him out of last summer’s World Cup. While he can still turn a game with one moment of brilliance, it would seem like folly to abandon him now. The most important moments of United’s season lie ahead and if Falcao can replicate Saturday's touch of class more regularly, he may yet emerge as the hero Old Trafford’s fans so desperately want him to be.\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"In a rare moment of brilliance at Old Trafford, Radamel Falcao won a crucial penalty for Manchester United during their match against Sunderland, which Wayne Rooney converted to secure a 1-0 victory. Falcao's skillful touch and subsequent foul by John O’Shea, which led to Wes Brown's mistaken red card, changed the course of the game. However, Falcao's performance was largely lackluster, and he was substituted for Marouane Fellaini shortly after winning the penalty, drawing boos from the crowd. Manager Louis van Gaal defended the decision, citing the need to retain possession. Falcao, who has scored only four goals in 17 league appearances this season, faces growing pressure to justify his loan deal from Monaco. Despite his recent struggles, Falcao's moment of quality and his consistent work ethic have kept United fans supportive. Van Gaal acknowledged that Falcao and Angel di Maria, who was also substituted at halftime, need more time to adapt to the Premier League. The manager's decision to replace Falcao may signal his doubts about making the loan permanent, but there remains a hope that Falcao can regain his form and become the 20-goal-a-season striker United desperately needs to challenge for a top-four finish.\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'President Bush on Wednesday signed the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, calling it a \"booster shot\" for the American economy. \"The bill I\\'m signing today is large enough to have an impact, amounting to more than $152 billion this year, or about 1 percent of the GDP (gross domestic product),\" the president said in the brief ceremony in the East Room of the White House. The government hopes the measure, which will send most Americans tax rebate checks by May, will either prevent a recession or make one relatively brief. The package also includes tax breaks for equipment purchases by businesses, as well as payments to disabled veterans and some senior citizens. The bipartisan measure moved through Congress at relative break-neck speed, going from initial discussions to enactment in less than four weeks. The package will pay $600 to most individual taxpayers and $1,200 to married taxpayers filing joint returns, so long as they are below income caps of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for couples. There is also a $300 per child tax credit. Watch Bush sign stimulus bill into law » . The rebates will put about $120 billion in the hands of individuals in the hope that they will spend it and boost a faltering U.S. economy. Economists generally agree that the economy should see a boost from the rebate checks. But most also agree that the full impact will be less than the total value of the stimulus package. That\\'s because some recipients are expected to save their rebates or use them to pay down credit cards or other debt instead of spending it. In addition, some consumers may spend their rebates on imported items, which would provide a more limited lift to the U.S. economy. \"My guess is that of the $110 billion to $120 billion of tax rebates, about half will go to U.S. products and services,\" said David Wyss, chief economist for Standard & Poor\\'s. There also are questions about whether the stimulus will actually be the key to ending or preventing a recession. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said last week that the Internal Revenue Service planned to send the rebate checks to about 130 million Americans. \"They\\'re going to be getting ready to get checks out, and believe me, they will. ... And this is largely going to be done by the time summer\\'s over. And so we\\'re going to move quickly and make a difference,\" he said . Bush praised the quick work of the House and Senate and urged Americans not to \"overreact\" to the current economic troubles. \"In the past seven years, the system has absorbed shocks: recession, corporate scandals, terror attacks, global war; yet the genius of our system is that it can absorb such shocks and emerge even stronger,\" he said. \"In a dynamic market economy, our economy will prosper and it will continue to be the marvel of the world.\"',\n",

              "  {'content': 'I worked with Scott McClellan in the West Wing for almost three years. Like most people, I liked Scott very much. But there is zero resemblance between the Scott I worked with and the person I have been watching this past week. None whatsoever. When I first heard about his book, \"What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington\\'s Culture of Deception,\" and read some of its excerpts, I tried to give Scott the benefit of the doubt and wait to read the book for myself. I mean, Scott McClellan is not some guy who met the president a few times and then decided to write a book, like another staffer did early on. This is a guy who had a great affection for the president, and that affection was mutual. As I read the book, I kept thinking I would come across evidence to back up the serious allegations Scott was making. I read more. I thought surely there will be some conversation that he claims to have overheard between adviser Karl Rove and President Bush, crafting some story to cover up the truth about Iraq or making the Iraq War sound political in nature. Or, maybe he witnessed some meeting, discovered a memo, or overheard a comment that confirmed his disillusionment. Still nothing. And then, I realized this book had no facts to support its ill-timed story. This book is false in premise, disappointing in substance and inappropriate in timing. First, the premise of the book is flawed for one major reason: This president placed some big bets on the table. For one, an attempt to reform the nation\\'s tragically flawed educational system, which has seen more and more money thrown into it to reward incompetence. For another, to go on the offense in a War on Terror after our nation had been in a dangerously naïve position for years. President Bush swung for the fence. The president\\'s efforts on these great issues of our time were not meant to be overnight solutions, but genuine efforts to change a faulty system or make us safer in the long term. You cannot mistake short-term media coverage for history. We will not know for many years how some of these big bets will pay off. So, to presume failure, when there is in fact real progress -- economically, politically, and militarily in Iraq -- is arrogant, short-sighted, and most tragically, undermines the efforts of those making the sacrifice to make America safer for years to come. The timing of this book is very disappointing. It is an outright attempt to undermine the president that made Scott\\'s career and hurt those who served alongside him for years. Obviously, had Scott actually been disillusioned while he was in the West Wing -- that would have been the time to share it with those standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him. But this takes courage, and that is a lot to ask of a staffer. The other option would have been to share these newfound feelings years from now, after the dust is settled and the results from a very significant presidency are tallied. To use the platform that he was handed to poison the well from which he drank so freely is hypocritical at best. Scott was chosen by the president for his loyalty, not his communication prowess. And in a tough final year of one of the most-challenging and consequential presidencies in history, this book is quite a thank-you note. Over the last week, I have been asked two questions over and over. First, \"What do you think happened to Scott?\" And, the second, \"How does it make you feel?\" Both are tough questions to answer. But because I was traveling when the story broke, I was able to process both before being inundated with the opinions of so many others. As for what happened to the Scott we knew, I believe his is a classic case of what bitterness and an inability to forgive can do to you. While Scott had some valid disagreements with some of the other staff about the situation he was put in during the Valerie Plame case --  simmering for two years about it seemed to change him. And as for how I feel, well, it makes me sad that he forced the rest of us to choose between a friend that we respected and a president we love. I believe Scott\\'s judgment was clouded and his memory distorted during his effort to revise his personal history and -- as he states in the opening pages of the book -- find \"his own version of the truth.\" I happen to believe there is just one version of the truth, and it is nowhere to be found in this book.',\n",

House Speaker John Boehner has said today that he ‘can’t imagine’ his conservative views on gay marriage will ever shift, even if he had a son who was gay. The Ohio Republican told ABC News’ Martha Raddatz for ‘This Week’ that he could not possibly see a situation where his views would change. Rep. Boehner’s firm stance goes directly against the remarkable about-face of fellow Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who publically said he supports gay marriage after his own son came out. Scroll down for video . Formed: House Speaker Boehner said today on ABC News' 'This Week' that he 'cant imagine' changing his views on gay marriage . 'Change of heart:' A family Christmas card shows Sen. Rob Portman and his wife, Jane, with their children, from left, Jed, 22, Will, 21, and Sally, 18. Sen. Portman announced he would embrace gay marriage in a shocking reversal on the issue . Speaking on ABC News’ ‘This Week,’ Rep. Boehner said: ‘Rob’s a great friend and a long-time ally.’ He went on to explain in the exclusive interview: ‘(But) I believe that marriage is the union of one man and one woman… It’s what I grew up with. It’s what I believe. It’s what my church teaches me. ‘And I can’t imagine that position would ever change.’ Traditional: Boehner, R-Ohio, said he still believes marriage is between a man and a woman . Ms Raddatz pushed the speaker to explore if there ever could be a situation, like that of Sen. Portman, where his views would shift. ‘Listen,’ Rep. Boehner responded. ‘I think that Rob can make up his own mind, take his own position. 'But I’ve made clear my position.’ Sen. Portman, who was on former presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s short list of running mates in the past election, made the surprising announcement on CNN last Thursday, as well as in an op-ed in the Columbus Dispatch. Doing so made him the first Republican senator to publically embrace the right of same-sex couples to marry. His son Will, a 21-year-old student at Yale University, came out to him two years ago. During the interview, Rep Boehner talked about striking a possible ‘grand-bargain,’ a measure to address the $16 trillion in U.S. debt and heralded the president’s recent efforts to promote bi-partisanship. But in the speaker’s mind, ‘the talk about raising revenue is over,’ adding that President Obama already raised taxes, effective January 1. ‘It’s time to deal with the spending problem’ and address the ‘looming’ debt crisis, he said. Old pals: When asked if Boehner trusts President Obama, he responded: 'Absolutely' When Ms Raddatz asked if he trusted the president, Rep. Boehner said: ‘Absolutely.’ ‘The president and I, as I have made clear, have a very good relationship,’ he said. ‘We’re open with each other.‘We’re honest with each other. But we’re trying to bridge some big differences.’ During the interview, Rep. Boehner touched upon several other hot-button issues, including gun control, the recent CPAC conference, and the election of Argentinian Pope Francis, the first South American pope in history.

As the next wave came, her body was dragged in one direction and her trapped hand in the other, a lawsuit filed in Galveston’s District Court claimed. Her age is not stated in the papers but her lawyer Daniel D. Horowitz said she is under 13. Painful: Serenity C.

Her screams for help were answered by other swimmers who rushed to her aid. However, when the finally managed to prize her hand free from the vent, part of her thumb down to the knuckle was missing, the lawsuit said. One of the swimmers who came to help held her hand above the water to try and stop the bleeding. Serenity was placed in wheelchair, and pressure was applied to her thumb until additional medical treatment was available, the lawsuit claims. No. 1 in America: According to its website Schlitterbahn has 'uphill water coasters, water slides, kid's playgrounds, whitewater rapids, wave pool, hot tubs, plus the Boogie Bahn surf ride' The lawsuit, seen by the Galveston Daily News, accuses the waterpark of negligence in creating a condition that posed an unreasonable risk of harm.

He\\'s been taken advantage of by those in the justice system,\" Ferguson said. Having served roughly a quarter of his 40-year sentence, Ferguson refused to speculate on whether prosecutors acted maliciously -- despite that two of the prosecution\\'s key witnesses later recanted their damning testimony and an appeals court judge ruled that prosecutors withheld evidence at trial. \"They\\'ve taken my 20s, and I\\'ll never have that back. ... Those are amazing years, obviously,\" he said. \"I\\'ve never really lived as an adult in the free world.\" The Jefferson City Correctional Center released Ferguson on Tuesday after Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said he wouldn\\'t retry Ferguson. Ferguson and Erickson, both 17 at the time, were drinking illegally at a college bar early on November 1, 2001. About five blocks away, Columbia Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt turned off his computer after a late night and walked out to the newspaper parking lot shortly after 2 a.m., according to court documents. Heitholt was struck from behind and strangled with his own belt, according to the documents. Police found hair, blood and fingerprints at the scene, and a police dog tracked a scent to a University of Missouri dorm, according to a website devoted to Ferguson\\'s defense. Police questioned a janitor, Jerry Trump, who said he could not identify the individuals involved in the crime, court documents say. More than two years later, Erickson told police he had \"dream-like\" memories of committing the crime, resulting in his and Ferguson\\'s March 2004 arrest. Ferguson told police that he recalled driving Erickson home that night before going home himself, according to the documents. Erickson implicated Ferguson at trial, as did Trump, who had gone to prison himself on a parole violation the month after the murder. Trump testified that a newspaper article his wife sent him in prison in early 2004 jogged his memory about what he saw that night, court documents say. That testimony was key to Ferguson\\'s release, because prosecutors had interviewed Trump\\'s wife, who denied sending him the article. Prosecutors failed to disclose that interview, and Judge Cynthia Martin, in a summary of last week\\'s decision, wrote, \"The undisclosed interview was material, resulting in a verdict that was not worthy of confidence.\" Ferguson found out he would be released when his lawyer came to the prison, holding up a piece of paper behind the protective glass that separates visitors from inmates. On it, she had quickly scrawled two words: \"It\\'s over.\" \"I feel like Jay Leno or something,\" Ferguson said to supporters after his release. He said his first stop as a free man might be at a Dairy Queen, and the profile photo on the Free Ryan Ferguson Facebook site was later updated to show a grinning Ferguson in a gray V-neck sweater, sitting at a bar with a beer and a steak. Now that he\\'s out, Ferguson said he and his legal team will be looking into the prosecution\\'s conduct in the case. He also said it was \"incredibly important\" to him that Heitholt\\'s killer be found. \"I believe we know who did it. It\\'s a matter of proving it and getting help from authorities at this point,\" he said, declining to name names. \"I think the facts show clearly who did it.\" It\\'s unclear if Ferguson is entitled to any compensation for his incarceration. Missouri law says wrongly incarcerated people are entitled to restitution, but only if they\\'re determined to be \"actually innocent\" as a result of DNA analysis. Though court documents say none of the DNA at the crime scene matched Ferguson or Erickson, the judge cited only the witness\\'s wife\\'s interview in overturning Ferguson\\'s conviction. \"The individual may receive an amount of fifty dollars per day for each day of post-conviction incarceration for the crime for which the individual is determined to be actually innocent,\" the statute says. Ferguson attributed his grace in this difficult time to his upbringing. While in prison, he read, studied and took care of himself while \"preparing for my life\" and never allowing himself to \"look too far into the future,\" he said previously. He added Wednesday that his confidence in his own innocence also helped him survived his decade in prison. \"I believe in myself. I know what I\\'ve done in my life. I know what\\'s right and wrong. ... I knew someday I would prove my innocence,\" he said. \"I just kept moving forward.\"',\n",

States in which the same scenario could play out \"are few and far between,\" GOP strategist and CNN political commentator Alex Castellanos said. \"Until we find such a rare state, it will do a Republican no good to promise more federal spending and benefits to minority voters.\" Bringing home the pork . Throughout the campaign, Cochran consistently pointed out his position on the  Senate Appropriations Committee and the multimillion-dollar projects he has funded in Mississippi, some of which bear his name, like the University of Southern Mississippi\\'s Thad Cochran Center. Jackson, Mississippi, also boasts the Jackson Medical Mall Thad Cochran Center -- a formerly run-down mall that an African-American doctor converted into a medical center with Cochran\\'s support, said D\\'Andra Orey, political science professor at Jackson State University. \"He\\'s done some things that are not black-specific, but things that blacks benefit from,\" Orey said. Many credited Cochran\\'s success at the ballot box to his ability to funnel federal dollars into his state -- the poorest in the country. Henry Barbour, who steered the pro-Cochran super PAC Mississippi Conservatives, said that Cochran\\'s long-standing relationships with the African-American community and ability to meet \"the needs of all the Mississippians\" helped Cochran win. \"It only worked because they had confidence in Sen. Cochran, whether it was a Republican voter we were talking to, an independent voter we were talking to, or even a Democratic voter,\" Barbour acknowledged. But still, Barbour said he does not \"think there\\'s any question\" that the strategy can be applied on a national level. \"We\\'ve got to genuinely go into the minority communities and communicate our message and explain to them why it\\'s good for them,\" Barbour said. Barbour called the election an impressive feat given the state\\'s violent history of race relations. Turnout spiked in Hinds County, which is 70% African-American and saw about 7,000 more voters for Cochran in the runoff than in the primary. While boasting a similar share of Cochran supporters, neighboring Madison County -- which is 38% African-American -- delivered much smaller gains for Cochran in the runoff. George Flaggs Jr., the mayor of Vicksburg, backed Cochran and encouraged other Democrats to support him at the polls, largely because his city\\'s economy is anchored in government-funded projects. \"(Sen. Cochran) is a person that demonstrates leadership in terms of helping with jobs and job creation,\" Flaggs said. \"I\\'m a black Democrat, but I try to be responsive to the needs of the city and the state.\" He added that Mississippi would be unable to compete for federal funds with states like New York or California without Cochran\\'s seniority in the Senate. Barbour said he was \"damned proud\" to ask African-Americans and Democrats for their support. \"One of the highlights of the runoff was working with African-Americans in a shared interest in our state,\" Barbour said. \"This is how you grow the party.\" Conservative activists slam Cochran for courting Democrats . Is the African-American vote up for grabs? ConservativeBlackChick.com\\'s Crystal Wright said the Mississippi race showed that neither party should take the black vote for granted. \"We don\\'t go out and earn the black vote,\" Wright said of the GOP. \"The only time the Republican Party is serious about going after the black vote is -- it\\'s like the vote of last resort. Blacks have become the vote of last resort and we need to say no more.\" Republicans could actually make inroads with African-Americans in the rural and suburban communities of the South, said Ravi K. Perry, a political science professor at Mississippi State University. Perry, who has written extensively about race in politics, said Cochran\\'s outreach to blacks is \"obviously a winning strategy\" and that the runoff showed that there is interest in the African-American community to have an impact on the political process. \"It\\'s not going to be a strategy that you\\'re going to throw away,\" Perry said. He added that many African-Americans are socially conservative and may find Republican candidates appealing, particularly if they can bring home federal dollars for the agriculture industry, which relies on subsidies. \"Democrats should not rest on their laurels and assume that the African-American vote is theirs and the GOP should not assume that it is out of their reach,\" Perry said. Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator Donna Brazile dispelled the idea that Democrats take the African-American vote for granted and said that Democrats are working to recruit and turn out more every election cycle. \"The only legitimate criticism ... is that we wait until the last minute to encourage African-Americans to vote,\" Brazile said. \"But when it comes to encouraging African-Americans to run for office, we\\'re at the table.\" But Brazile said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is making an \"aggressive effort\" to recruit and register African-Americans and other minorities in key states this cycle . DSCC National Press Secretary Justin Barasky said the group is already spending to raise turnout in battleground states to near-2012 levels and will be \"making an unprecedented investment\" to keep the Senate in Democratic hands. Registering and turning out African-Americans will be a key part of this strategy, particularly in Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana, Barasky said. Forming a more inclusive party . Danny Vargas, former chairman of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly, was wary to draw any broader conclusions from the unique Mississippi runoff, but said the race is a reminder the GOP needs to cast a wider net. \"Nationally, if we ever hope to win back the White House, we need to have an approach that\\'s inclusive of every segment of society,\" Vargas, who is also president of VARCom Solutions, said. \"The poor of our country are not the problem, they\\'re the ones most in need of our solutions.\" Vargas suggested the GOP should show how its market-oriented solutions can empower all types of communities. \"You just need to show up. You need to be willing to go to Hispanic bodegas, black churches or mosques,\" he said. Beyond African-Americans, Republicans will also need to draw Hispanic voters to remain a viable party as that population is projected to triple by 2050. John Bruce, chair of the University of Mississippi\\'s political science department, called the runoff an \"exceptional\" case and said no one should expect any significant shifts in racial partisanship. But Cochran\\'s strategy of courting the African-American vote proved successful -- whether because of his record of funding projects in Mississippi or the fear of being represented by someone like McDaniel. \"Anytime something works in politics, someone else will try to copy it,\" Bruce said. McDaniel says \\'hundreds\\' of irregularities found in Mississippi race . Mississippi primary spending surge pushes advertisers off the air .',\n",

              "  {'content': \"In Mississippi's recent Senate runoff, incumbent Republican Thad Cochran secured a narrow victory over challenger Chris McDaniel, in part by mobilizing African-American voters, who typically support Democrats. Cochran's success was attributed to his long-standing relationships with the African-American community and his ability to secure federal funding for projects that benefit the state, the poorest in the country. Turnout in Hinds County, which is 70% African-American, increased significantly, contributing to Cochran's win. GOP strategist Alex Castellanos noted that such a strategy is rare and may not be easily replicable in other states. However, some Republican leaders, like Henry Barbour, believe the approach can be applied nationally, emphasizing the need to engage minority communities genuinely. Conservative activists, however, criticized Cochran for courting Democrats, arguing that the GOP should not rely on minority votes as a last resort. Political scientists and strategists suggest that both parties need to work harder to engage African-American voters, who may be open to Republican candidates if they can demonstrate how their policies benefit their communities. Democrats, meanwhile, are making efforts to register and turn out more African-American voters in key states, particularly in Georgia, South Carolina, and Louisiana. The race highlights the importance of inclusive strategies for both\",\n",

Though it is the working theory, . county sheriff spokeswoman Cecilia Barreda said that they cannot be . certain that the medication was used to make the boys drowsy or . unconscious before 34-year-old Brown drowned them.

Her husband was believed to have told his wife that he wanted to end their eight-year on the night of Friday September 21 before going out for the evening in Clearwater. In the early hours of Saturday, police discovered Mrs Brown and her children, nine-year-old Zander and five-year-old Zayden, dead in the suburban home after receiving a call from Mr Brown. Friend and neighbor William Lavold told Tampa Bay Online that Mr Brown, 36, was distraught. He said: 'He can't function. He can't figure it out. He's done in. He's really done in.' Awful: Police found the three bodies shortly after 2am Saturday; authorities did not give a possible motive for the killing . 'Murder suicide': Police believe that the mother killed her sons before she hanged herself at home in the early hours of Saturday . Dawn Brown was charged last year with welfare fraud and had faced foreclosure on the family home several times. A neighbor was supplying them with electricity via an extension cord. Authorities believe she murdered the children sometime on Friday night before hanging herself. The boys' cause of death will be released after an autopsy today. A neighbor of the family, Nichole Bell, told the paper that the two brothers attended McMullen-Booth Elementary School with her son, who was one of Zander’s best friends. 'I can't believe it. She was so interested in her kids' educations,' Ms Bell said. Bell told the paper that her son and Zander got in a fight at the bus stop on Friday morning and had to go to a guidance counselor when they arrived at school. Mr Lavold said that he was like a godfather to the young boys and that they had planned to go out on his boat at the weekend. Lavold said that he received a text about trouble at the home around 3am but only saw it three hours later and rushed to the house, by which time the mother and boys had died.

The CCG – which covers a population of 900,000 – has yet to decide how much weight they must lose but it could be several stone to bring them down into the ‘obese’ or ‘overweight’ range. Similarly, it is demanding that smokers give up for at least six weeks before being put on the waiting list for all non-urgent surgery. But experts accused managers of ‘prescriptively’ rationing vital treatment from patients just because of their lifestyle choices. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, pointed out that operations such as hip and knee replacements would be hugely beneficial for the obese in helping them exercise. ‘This is a prescriptive and cost-cutting measure.’ ‘Such operations would be hugely cost effective in the long term and highly beneficial for patients. ‘It’s just rationing.’ The organisation said it had no choice and needed to ensure there was enough money to care for patients during the busy winter months. But it is not the first time managers have resorted to such arbitrary measures to cut costs. Smokers will have to give up for at least six weeks before being put on the waiting list . In 2012 it emerged that a quarter of trusts were restricting at least one procedures from the obese or smokers – although in most cases it was IVF. At the time, managers pointed out that surgery can be riskier and less effective for patients who are very overweight or who smoke. They are more likely to develop potentially fatal complications as a result of the general anaesthetic including pneumonia, blood clots, heart attacks or kidney failure. Hip and knee replacements tend to be less successful in the obese and there is also evidence they benefit less from IVF. As part of its cost-cutting measures, the CCG is also making it harder for all patients to have cataract surgery or hernias removed. They will have to meet certain criteria before being eligible which might include a certain amount of sight loss or having restricted movement. Patients who have a body mass index of 40 or higher - which is equivalent to a 6ft man weighing just over 20 stone - will be targeted . Rebecca Harriott, the CCG’s chief officer, said: ‘We must act to protect essential services through our busiest winter months and ensure that care is there for our patients when they really need it,” she said. ‘The CCG has already begun to implement a series of measures designed to improve efficiency in the system and encourage patients to contribute to improving their own health outcomes. ‘These measures bring the CCG into line with similar organisations in the NHS. However, they are not enough. ‘The CCG is working up a series of measures to prioritise those patients most in need, while at the same time, increasing efficiency in the wider system – and the CCG itself.’',\n",

The CCG, which serves a population of 900,000, argues that these measures are necessary to ensure financial stability and maintain essential services during the winter months.

              "  {'content': 'While China is seriously cracking down on the exchange of virtual currencies for real cash, virtual economies backed by newfound legitimacy elsewhere are quickly gaining ground in the real world. There\\'s gold in them there screens: Real-money transactions in virtual worlds are finding new legitimacy. On June 24, 2009, the role-playing game 140 Mafia launched on Twitter, following in the footsteps of highly lucrative games Mob Wars and Mafia Wars on Facebook (and now iPhone) to link virtual-currency exchanges to real-money transactions. In March 2009, MindArk -- creator of the MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) Entropia, where one player famously bought an island for US$26,500 in 2004 -- saw its wholly owned subsidiary Mind Bank granted a banking license from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. The new license allows Mind Bank to be the first bank to directly incorporate real-money transactions with virtual-world activities. Selling virtual assets directly between players for real-world cash has been strictly prohibited by most game publishers, which find themselves looped out of the profits. What has been profitable in the meantime to some hardcore players of World of Warcraft and EverQuest (and other games) is \"gold farming\" -- accumulation of \"gold,\" weapons and other status symbols of a seasoned player -- followed by the online auction of such assets or user accounts. Since games publishers began policing eBay for this type of unauthorized activity, several Web sites such as PlayerAuctions have adopted a PayPal-like approach in order to broker the trading legally, acting as an open marketplace for player-to-player exchange of digital assets. Dual-currency economies . However younger games (often aimed at younger audiences) are ditching the conventional subscription-based model of the above games to adopt the \"freemium\" model, which lets users play for free, but allows them to enhance their experience by purchasing accessories or other premiums through micropayments. Frenzoo, a \"3D fashion game for girls\", is one game that has adopted this model. CEO Simon Newstead explains: \"The idea with dual currencies is that there is a paid currency [Gold Coins], which is paid for using real money and exchanged between sellers and buyers. In addition, there is a second currency -- a free or so-called \\'earned\\' currency [Silver Coins] -- which is gained through activity and progression in the world or game.\" \"In this way,\" he continues, \"the economy can recognize different forms of contribution, and in newer economies these can also be traded between each other. For example, people earning currency and selling it to people who have less time but have real money.\" Mirrored economies . As one of the first successful virtual economies, Second Life\\'s huge marketplace includes objects and services for sale, as well as a real estate market. In 2008, more than $100 million worth of the world\\'s Linden dollars were bought and sold on Second Life\\'s official LindeX exchange, according to its Web site. \"In Linden Exchange, the U.S. dollar part of the transaction is via PayPal, a well-known entity, so there\\'s a certain amount of trust that comes with it,\" says Darrly Chang, co-founder of D&D Dogs, a two-man freelance venture that sells virtual dog pets and avatars to Second Life residents. Recently, however, business has slumped along with the real-world recession. \"We\\'ll continue to see a proliferation of alternative currencies associated with specific platforms and communities, much as frequent-flier miles are associated with individual airlines or even networks of airlines,\" says Dan Jansen, CEO of Virtual Greats, which specializes in creating branded, copyrighted material for virtual worlds. \"In the longer term we may see a global standard for virtual currencies, but it will take some time.\" Golden e-currency? James Turk, chairman of digital-gold company GoldMoney, agrees. \"But,\" he adds, \"inevitably digital gold currency will make significant inroads in global commerce because it lowers the cost of transacting with one another. Reducing transaction costs creates more opportunities for global commerce.\" In March 2009, GoldMoney launched a dedicated iPhone application allowing its account holders to exchange gold and silver units within minutes. Putting a trendy iPhone application that allows people to manage their own digital gold on par with other popular banking applications branded by well-established banks brings e-currency a step closer to the modern mobile end-user. Furthermore, GoldMoney is firmly anchored to real-world assets and individuals, notably strictly forbidding anonymous accounts -- unlike the former incarnation of the pioneering company E-Gold, whose founder this month ends his six-month house arrest in Florida after pleading guilty to money laundering-related crimes. So how realistic is the prospect of a single, global, digital currency? \"It all comes down to trust,\" says senior economist Frederic Neumann. \"We trust the government to guarantee our \\'virtual\\' money for real currency. [With digital gold] the gold standard is guaranteed by a private company. Governments already have several hundred years of sovereignty engrained in people\\'s minds, so that trust is very difficult to establish.\"',\n",

              "  {'content': 'Former FBI Director Louis Freeh will lead an independent inquiry for Penn State University into the school\\'s response to child sex abuse allegations, trustee Kenneth Frazier said Monday. \"No one -- no one -- is above scrutiny, including every member of the administration of the university, every member of our board of trustees, and every employee of the university,\" said Frazier, who was appointed to chair the special investigative committee into the university\\'s response to allegations involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. A grand jury reported this month that university officials allegedly knew of allegations of misconduct on Sandusky\\'s part, but failed to fully act on them. Freeh, who will serve as special investigative counsel, said he extracted pledges of support and non-interference from university officials before taking on the job. \"This assurance is the main condition of my engagement,\" he said. He said will appoint a team of former FBI agents and former federal prosecutors from his law firm to assist. Results of the investigation will be released to trustees and the public at about the same time, he said. It\\'s unclear how effective Freeh will be, said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"Louis Freeh is an honorable person, but the question is whether he will have the tools to do a thorough investigation.\" Toobin said. With police, the university and even Sandusky\\'s former charity, The Second Mile, conducting their own investigations, it\\'s unclear whether witnesses will want to repeat their stories over and over again, he said. At the heart of the scandal are accusations that Sandusky, the retired defensive coordinator for the Penn State football team, sexually abused a boy at the university football complex, and that law enforcement officials were not notified. According to grand jury documents, a graduate assistant told head football coach Joe Paterno in 2002 that he had seen Sandusky performing anal sex on a young boy in a football complex shower. Paterno told athletic director Tim Curley, who told Gary Schultz, a university vice president. Some information about the allegations eventually reached President Graham Spanier, according to the grand jury. Paterno has said he did \"what I was supposed to do.\" But in a later statement, he said \"with the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more.\" While it took years for the alleged abuse to become public, school officials moved quickly after prosecutors charged Sandusky, 67, with 40 counts in the alleged sexual abuse of eight young boys over several years. Authorities also charged Curley and Schultz with misleading the grand jury investigating the allegations and failing to report suspected abuse. Curley and Schultz stepped aside within a day of the charges, and before the week was out, trustees had fired both Paterno -- the winningest football coach in Division I history -- and Spanier. The university\\'s special committee, created six days after Sandusky\\'s arrest, empowered Freeh to \"take his team\\'s work to wherever it leads,\" Frazier said. The NCAA and the U.S. Department of Education are also investigating the university\\'s response. Freeh said he did not know how much the investigation will cost, or how long it will take, other than that it will be lengthy. Investigators had already begun work reviewing documents in the case, he said. While he does not have the subpoena power he enjoyed as an FBI official, Freeh said he is counting on the cooperation of law enforcement and the Penn State community, which is eager to restore the university\\'s reputation. \"In my current role, I will encourage everyone to speak to us,\" he said. Frazier said the scandal has caused irreparable harm to the school, but officials are determined to make sure it never happens again. \"Words alone cannot express the heartbreak and sorrow we feel for the victims,\" he said.',\n",

Tesco's shares plunged again this morning after its new boss refused to reveal how he would tackle the biggest crisis in its 95-year history. The supermarket giant yesterday revealed half-year profits slumped by 91.9 per cent and its £263million accounting scandal was even worse than predicted. The news triggered another dramatic slump in Tesco shares, which closed down 12p at £1.71, and they have continued to dive-bomb today. This morning they were available for £1.65 but a year ago they were worth £3.70, meaning Tesco has had £4billion wiped off its stock market value in just 12 months. Millions of customers have switched to budget rivals like Aldi and Lidl or high-end Waitrose and Marks and Spencer because Tesco has failed to deliver on price, service or quality, . But CEO Dave Lewis yesterday refused to be drawn on what he would do to win back shoppers. He said: 'Everybody's been saying to me, 'Dave, when are you going to reveal your strategy – when is there going to be an announcement about what you're going to do?' And I won't be doing that because strategies are constantly evolving. 'So, there won't be an announcement of Tesco's new strategy. That will be for me and the management teams only.' He did say though he would 'begin the long journey of rebuilding trust and transparency in the business and the brand.” He added: 'As of today, we draw a line under the accounting issue. We dealt with it completely and then we start again in terms of looking at the business going forward.' Trouble: Tesco profits have fallen by 91 per cent yesterday after the supermarket announced falling sales and a £250million accounting scandal . Bloodbath: This graph shows how Tesco's shares have plummeted in the past two days, dropping to a rock bottom price of £1.65 . Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent also ran for cover yesterday to try to dodge questions about the crisis. He raced out of a briefing with journalists amid high emotions and crashing furniture when challenged to defend the 92 per cent slump in profits. Extraordinary: Tesco's share price was at just under £4 18 months ago but now it is around £1.65 . Sir Richard - who quit the company yesterday - denied any wrongdoing or failures before escaping through a door that was then barred by a company minder. He stormed out of the press briefing when Channel 4 News economics correspondent, Paul Mason, asked: ‘Why should anyone put up with this level of incompetence running a major company?’ Mr Lewis then told reporters: ‘I don’t think the business is in a big hole. I am really very hopeful that we can get Tesco back to be the force that it has been.’ Chief executive Philip Clarke quit in the summer, with Dave Lewis parachuted in last month as the new CEO. Chief finance officer Laurie McIlwee left in April and has only just been replaced. Tesco is already reeling from the suspension of eight senior executives amid allegations that profits for the first half of the year were artificially inflated by £250million. Yesterday it emerged that the true scale of the black hole was £263million, with the problem dating back to 2012. Tesco also revealed that pre-tax profits for the six months to August 23 plummeted from £1.39billion last year to just £112million, with like-for-like sales down 4.6 per cent as families switch to budget rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. Running for cover: Departing Tesco chairman\\xa0Sir Richard Broadbent raced out of a press briefing yesterday . Stark: Tesco was considered untouchable but its profit fall in the past year has been unprecedented . Sir Richard, 61, who will leave his £625,000-a-year post next year, refused to accept that he or the board had failed, insisting: 'I think the company has been well governed'. But he added: 'The issues that have come to light over recent weeks are a matter of profound regret.' He stormed out of the press briefing when Channel 4 News economics correspondent, Paul Mason, asked: 'Why should anyone put up with this level of incompetence running a major company?' Mr Lewis then told reporters: 'I don't think the business is in a big hole. I am really very hopeful that we can get Tesco back to be the force that it has been.' Tesco also announced that it is suspending multi-million-pound 'golden goodbye' bonuses for Mr Clarke and Mr McIlwee. Mr Clarke was due to receive 18 months' pay – £1.7 million – plus deferred share awards worth up to £5million. Mr McIlwee was due £971,000 pay and deferred share awards of up to £3million. Battle of the supermarkets: Tesco is by far the largest supermarket in Britain, but it is losing market share to its rivals, especially cheaper supermarkets like Aldi and Lidl .\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"Demonstrators in New York who have been protesting the grand jury decision in Ferguson this week are plotting a revolt against the Thanksgiving Day Parade to 'make people stop and listen' and 'make history'. The hashtag #StopTheParade set social media on fire on Wednesday night, after thousands took over the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn on Tuesday after police officer Darren Wilson escaped charges over the shooting death of Michael Brown. The New York Post is reporting that those protests - in which 10 of an estimated 3,000 were arrested - have inspired a bigger plan to use the spotlight surrounding the parade to push what they say is injustice. A notice posted to Facebook read: 'We do not accept state violence or genocide as cause for celebration. When the masses gather for the Thanksgiving Day Parade, we will gather to remind the public that BLACK LIVES MATTER. 'We will meet on the steps of the Public Library bright and early to plan exact flash mob location and make our signs. Please bring cardboard/posterboard small enough to hide on your person and markers.' Scroll down for video . Drumming up support: This post was circulating Facebook Wednesday night, urging people to join a flash mob that will hit the\\xa0the 88th Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade . Time and place: The group are set to meet at the New York Public Library at 7am to plan the protest, so as not to telegraph their plans online . #StopTheParade: Twitter was alight with people supporting the push against the Thanksgiving Day Parade . Plan: A map of the parade and of a plan of how to disrupt it was being spread on Twitter . 'With this hands-off approach (by police), it gives (protesters) free rein to do anything they want,' a law enforcement source told The Post. 'It’s a free pass to act like a fool.' However a central part of the parade each year is a significant police presence. While Tuesday night's protests were spontaneous, catching police off guard, the same cannot be said for the parade, which brings the city to a halt. 'They’re not going to be able to do at the parade what they did at the Brooklyn Bridge,' the source added to the post. 'What are they going to do, trample kids to stop a float?' The Facebook post that was circulating Wednesday maintained that demonstrators do not want to disrupt the parade. 'We are not interrupting the march, we are making a statement in the crowds,' the post said. 'However, this is a HIGHLY POLICED event. 'NYPD acts as parade security, so be aware, and understand we are not posting all details to the web.' Will the weather get better? New York City experienced rain and snow Wednesday - just one day before the 88th Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade . Getting ready: A worker is seen inflating a Papa Smurf balloon on Wednesday . Secret magic: Helium is the stuff that makes Snoopy, Spider-Man, Papa Smurf and other huge balloons sail high above the crowd at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York . A protest is not the only obstacle the parade - now in its 88th year - is going to have to overcome in order to run smoothly today. New York City experienced both rain and snow Wednesday, leaving the city wet and cold for the thousands of spectators set to turn out to watch. Fortunately Thursday is expected to see dry weather with some clouds, the Weather Channel reported. The likes of Papa Smurf, Spider-Man and Spongebob were photographed being inflated by workers on Wednesday. Both onlookers and workers were snapped bundled up near the balloons as rain poured down. Almost showtime: A Spongebob Squarepants balloon is seen in Manhattan on Wednesday.\\xa0The amount of helium needed for the parade balloons has to be enough to fill 600,000 to 700,000 Mylar party balloons . Inclement weather:\\xa0Both onlookers and workers were snapped bundled up near the balloons on Wednesday, with rain pouring down . On the scene: Balloon crewman Kevin Jackson gets out Wednesday from under some of the balloons that are part of the 15,000 Macy's balloons for the parade and will transport them to New York . Helping hand: Workers helped out with the balloons despite the bad weather . It'll never rank up there with turkey and pumpkin pie, but for millions of Americans the Thanksgiving experience just wouldn't be the same without.. helium. For 364 days of the year, the colorless and odorless gas works quietly behind the scenes, doing jobs like chilling magnets in MRI imaging machines and helping welders protect their work from impurities. But on Thanksgiving, the lighter-than-air element moves onto a much bigger stage. It's the stuff that makes Snoopy, Spider-Man, Papa Smurf and other huge balloons sail high above the crowd at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. Just so we can be properly thankful for the second most abundant element in the universe (it ranks behind hydrogen), AP turned for some basic facts to Eric Bass. He is product manager for helium at Linde North America Inc. This week, for the 20th straight year, his company will supply the gas to the parade, which in turn is marking its 88th year. Helium forms underground and tends to mingle with natural gas deposits. So when companies extract and process the natural gas, they separate out the helium and sell it to companies like Linde. Helium is shipped worldwide, so the stuff that will pump up Paddington Bear or Pikachu could come from as close as Kansas or Wyoming, or as far away as Qatar, Africa or even Australia. The gas is first chilled for it gets to the parade, so it can be made into a liquid and it's easier to transport. Huge, specialized containers of the stuff are shipped to a plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Gas floats above the liquid in these containers; this gas is drawn off and compressed. The gas is loaded into heavy steel tubes, and 10 to 12 tubes are put on each of four flatbed trucks. The day before the parade, the trucks drive into Manhattan for the inflating of the parade balloons. Crews fill the balloons with long hoses, topping them off on parade day. The amount of helium needed for the parade has to be enough to fill 600,000 to 700,000 Mylar party balloons. But the parade helium is 99.999 percent pure, whereas the stuff in a party balloon might be only 97.5 percent pure. Heroic effort: Spider-Man was seen getting prepared for the parade with puddles on the street next to him . Blasting through: A balloon depicting Thomas the Tank Engine was also being prepared, as workers donned yellow rain gear . The balloons, meanwhile, come in a variety of sizes. According to Macy's, Snoopy is as tall as a three-story building, as long as 11 bicycles and as wide as five taxi cabs. The big balloons are made up of multiple chambers that are inflated individually. After the parade, the helium escapes to the atmosphere as the balloons are deflated. In 2008, Linde tried recycling some of the gas by withdrawing it through tubes put into some of the balloons. But Bass said the process was expensive, and there wasn't enough time to recover most of the gas before the streets had to be cleared for traffic. Multiple celebrities are set to appear at the parade, a handful of which include Hilary Duff, Romeo Santos, Nick Jonas, Lucy Hale, Idinia Menzel, Meghan Trainor, John LeClair, Pat LaFontaine, and Quvenzhané Wallis, and even the Taney Dragons according to NBC. Musical numbers from several Broadway productions, including 'Honeymoon in Vegas' and 'On the Town' are also expected.

The talks come as Paypal prepares to split from eBay in 2015, allowing it to take on competitors like Apply Pay more easily. And by purchasing Square, the company seems to be gearing up to give its users access to faster and easier transactions. Paypal (stock image of app shown) is gearing up to acquire San Francisco-based start-up Square, which lets people make payments over their phone by linking their cards. A recent valuation suggests it is worth more than £3.8bn ($6bn). The mobile service would help Paypal take on competitors like Apple Pay . According to Bank Innovation the talks are in early stages but have been described as 'serious'. With Paypal apparently looking to move into the mobile payments business, the merger would allow the company to get a leg up on its competition. San Francisco-based Square lets users make payments via their phone. Square lets merchants accept credit-card payments over mobile phones and tablets with smaller fees than they had been paying via traditional credit-card networks. It offers a number of services including Square Order, which lets businesses see when a customer using the app is approaching. The app can tell a barista at a coffee shop, for example, when you are coming in, thanks to your phone's GPS. They can then have your favourite coffee ready and waiting - and the app can even pay the bill using your stored credit card information. Square Cash, meanwhile, lets users send up to £160 ($250) a week to any email address, on any email provider without the need to sign up and manage an account each time. A debit or credit card can be linked to your device, and money can then be sent to any email address or other services. It was founded in 2009 by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. The first app and service for Square launched in 2010, and it is now predicted to be worth more than £3.8 billion ($6 billion). That’s based on a recent valuation after they raised $150 million, reported the New York Times. The merger would seemingly help both in the face of mounting competition from Apple Pay and elsewhere. CEO Jack Dorsey took to Twitter to deny that any merger was imminent, saying the news was ‘false’. However Bank Innovation notes that the company denied similar reports that Google was attempting to acquire the company earlier this year, despite confirmations from elsewhere. PayPal's impending split from long-time partner eBay, meanwhile, is expected to ratchet up its appeal to online retail competitors such as Amazon.com and give it the freedom to aggressively take on new mobile pay challenger Apple Pay. And it will also give it more opportunities to make acquisitions such as this one of Square, if the merger turns out to be true. CEO Jack Dorsey says the news of a merger is 'false'.

              "  {'content': 'In a matter of weeks, teenage girls, just 17 years old, will be able to get their hands on the \"morning after pill\" without ever talking to a doctor and without their parents ever knowing or being a part of this major decision. Think of a 17-year-old girl. Most of the time she\\'s a high school senior, still living at home with Mom and Dad. She still needs her parents in the tough times. But they will be cut out of a traumatic situation. All thanks to U.S. District Judge Edward Korman. Korman stated in his order, \"The record shows that FDA officials and staff both agreed that 17-year-olds can use Plan B safely without a prescription.\" Now keep in mind birth control pills require a doctor\\'s prescription, but a drug that is more powerful doesn\\'t? The effective ingredient in Plan B is the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel and this is also found in daily oral contraceptives. Some forms of birth control that require a prescription have levonorgestrel, while Plan B has significantly more of the synthetic hormone. Do we really want our daughters putting something like this in their bodies without a doctor? I still want Mom and Dad in on this. Some argue that a girl can get an abortion without parental notification in some states, so why not Plan B? But just because those states got it wrong by leaving parents out of the loop doesn\\'t mean others should follow suit. And the larger point is, society must help parents, not undermine their rights by keeping them in the dark on their child\\'s life-changing decision. Here\\'s some perspective for you: In most states, minors can\\'t get a tattoo, body piercings or go to a tanning salon without a parent\\'s permission, but we are going to leave them alone to take Plan B. The \"morning after pill,\" or Plan B, is 89 percent effective in preventing pregnancy when it\\'s taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. It\\'s no surprise that Planned Parenthood applauds the now broader access to this drug, calling it \"a strong statement to American women that their health comes before politics.\" I question that, when we are cutting a doctor out of the decision to administer a powerful drug. Timing is essential to the drug\\'s effectiveness, Plan B supporters say, so getting parents and doctors involved would unnecessarily delay the teen\\'s ability to pop the pill the \"morning after.\" Does it really take that long to get a prescription? I also don\\'t buy the argument that this will help with unplanned pregnancies and abortions. The Center for Reproductive Rights says making Plan B more widely available could reduce them, but The New York Times reports that since 18-year-olds were allowed to get Plan B without a prescription in 2006, there has been no evidence of it having an effect on the country\\'s teen pregnancy or abortion rates. But let\\'s get back to the first point: We are making it available to high school girls. We\\'re enabling teenagers to act carelessly with an easy way out. During a recent discussion on my show, Jackie Morgan MacDougall, supervising producer of the Web site Momlogic.com, said it best. \"Teenagers are known for thinking they\\'re untouchable and here we are saying that they can continue to do that and that there aren\\'t any consequences.\" With Plan B, they can do it now and deal with it later. Don\\'t tell me high school dynamics won\\'t play in here. The boyfriend will talk his girlfriend into unprotected sex with the promise of buying the \"morning after pill\" the next day. Any 17-year-old boy will be able to buy this drug, just as any 17-year-old girl will. Yes, this could encourage unprotected sex and that means a greater risk for sexually transmitted diseases. What about the 17-year-old girl who may get Plan B for her 15-year-old sophomore friend? These are the kind of decisions high school girls will make. Korman didn\\'t stop there. He asked the FDA to consider making Plan B available to girls of any age. That\\'s a slippery slope and what\\'s worse, the ones who will fall are our daughters. Think of a 14-year-old girl taking Plan B without the love, support and guidance of parents and without the medical supervision of a doctor. Yes, teens have sex and difficult situations will arise, but should we open the door for our girls to go through this alone? That is not what is best for our daughters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Galanos.',\n",

This decision is based on the FDA\\'s agreement that 17-year-olds can use Plan B safely. However, critics argue that the drug, which contains a higher dose of synthetic progestin levonorgestrel than regular birth control pills, should still require medical supervision. The ruling has sparked debate over the role of parents in their children\\'s health decisions, with some pointing out that minors need parental consent for activities like tattoos and tanning, but not for taking Plan B. Supporters of the decision, including Planned Parenthood, argue that easier access to Plan B could reduce unplanned pregnancies and abortions, though evidence from when 18-year-olds gained similar access in 2006 shows no significant impact on teen pregnancy or abortion rates. Critics also warn that the ruling could encourage risky sexual behavior and increase the risk of sexually transmitted diseases.

              "  {'content': 'Since March 11, the six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been in various states of disrepair after being battered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Here is the latest on the status of each reactor and what was being done to prevent further emissions of radioactive material. Reactor No. 1 . Pressure and temperature levels at the No. 1 reactor continue to fluctuate, though Hidehiko Nishiyama of Japan\\'s nuclear and industrial safety agency told reporters Friday that the situation then appeared \"rather stable.\" While conceding that \"controlling the temperature and pressure has been difficult,\" Nishiyama said there were indications that the pressure and temperature were both decreasing. Authorities hope to begin injecting fresh water, rather than seawater as has been done, into the reactor\\'s spent nuclear fuel pool. According to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, a nuclear industry group basing its data on official government and utility information, the No. 1 unit\\'s reactor core has been damaged, but its containment vessel was not. As of Friday, the reactor\\'s cooling systems were still not operational. Still, the building was \"severely damaged\" by an earlier hydrogen explosion. While electricity issues remain, lighting has been restored for this and the No. 2 reactors. Reactor No. 2 . Like with No. 1, there has been evidence of high radiation levels in spots in and around the No. 2 reactor -- though not as high as that of the No. 3 unit. Nishiyama said Friday that authorities hope to start injecting fresh water (rather than the current seawater) into the reactor\\'s core and spent nuclear fuel pool. The water is being pumped in to help cool down nuclear fuel rods and prevent the further emission of radioactive material. Damage is \"suspected\" in this unit\\'s containment vessel -- the only such vessel so compromised, according to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. The reactor\\'s core is also thought to be damaged. But the building itself has only been \"slightly damaged,\" the same group reports. That said, the containment vessel pressure is considered \"stable,\" the nuclear industry trade group reports. Reactor No. 3 . The water that three men stepped in while laying cable in the basement of the No. 3 unit\\'s turbine building had 10,000 times the amount of radiation typical for that locale, Nishiyama said. The workers -- each of whom tested 170 or more millisieverts of radiation, including two with direct exposure on the skin -- were admitted Friday for four days of observation at Japan\\'s National Institute for Radiological Sciences, a research hospital in Chiba. He noted that the contamination likely came from the reactor\\'s core, adding there\\'s a possibility of \"some sort of leakage.\" That potentially could come from a crack in the reactor core, though Nishiyama cautioned that there is no definitive answer yet on how the radioactivity got into the basement. Despite the suspected damage to the reactor core -- something that isn\\'t presumed at any of the other five reactors -- the nuclear safety official said there is evidence that pressure is somehow being maintained in the vessel, making it less likely there is a big gash. \"Radiation levels are high\" in some locations in and around the reactor, Nishiyama said. These issues, including the radiation in the water, are prompting authorities to consider \"other routes\" to address issues at the reactor without exposing workers to excess radiation. Nishiyama said that, as of Friday afternoon, there was no firm plan on workarounds. Firefighters from Kawasaki, with assistance from the Tokyo fire department, sprayed water Friday on the No. 3 reactor and its spent nuclear fuel pool. The building of the No. 3 reactor was \"severely damaged\" after an explosion caused by the buildup of hydrogen gas, reports the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. Its core reactor is also damaged, its fuel rods are either partly or fully exposed. As to its nuclear spent fuel pool, reports are that the pool was \"possibly damaged\" and the water level has been low -- a reason for the repeated spraying. Reactor No. 4 . A concrete pump truck was used once again Friday to inject seawater into the unit\\'s fuel pool. Along with the Nos. 5 and 6 units, the No. 4 was offline on a scheduled outage when the earthquake hit, and as a result the reactor\\'s water level and pressure are continued safe. But its nuclear spent fuel pool was \"possibly damaged,\" which is why authorities have said its water levels are low and why they\\'ve made repeated efforts to fill it up with seawater. Reactor No. 5 . The No. 5 unit appears safe, for now, Nishiyama said. Its capability to cool the fuel rods in the spent fuel pool is working again, according to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. As with units Nos. 4 and 6, this reactor was off on a scheduled outage when the quake hit and there are no major issues with the reactor and core itself. The nuclear spent fuel pool is thought to be functioning, aside from continued concerns about powering its cooling system to ensure that the fuel rods contained within remain cool. As with unit No. 6, three holes were punched in the building earlier in order to relieve pressure and prevent a hydrogen explosion. Reactor No. 6 . The No. 6 unit appears safe, for now, Nishiyama said. Its capability to cool the fuel rods in the spent fuel pool is working again, according to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. The No. 6 reactor was offline when the tsunami struck, and there are no major concerns about the structure or safety of its core or containment vessel.

British-born philanthropist Kameron Segal, 48, was hit in the face and chest in a parking lot on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, on Friday night just before leaving work to discuss a $5million business deal. The CEO of Williams Holdings property and acquisitions\\xa0was sitting behind the wheel of his $300,000 Rolls Royce Wraith at the time and may have escaped death because the bullets hit the denser glass - which are installed to mute exterior sounds. The LAPD are still searching for the man who fled the scene on his bike after firing into the car. His family, including his four-year-old son, are believed to have travelled from the UK to be at his bedside in LA. Mr Segal's friends believe that he may have been the victim of a 'high-priced' hit as nothing was stolen from the car. Closing a deal: Kameron Segal, 48, was about to close a $5 million deal when he was shot on Friday. The thick glass on his $300,000 car may have saved his life . Scene: Segal was shot in the face and chest in a parking lot on Sunset Boulevard before leaving to meet his business partner on Friday night . Motive: Mr Segal's friends believe he may have been the victim of a 'high-price' hit as nothing was stolen from the car. A manhunt for the suspect is still underway . Josh Karp, a salesman at Meltdown Comics, which is just a couple of doors down from the parking lot, said he saw a 'stark naked' man get out of the car covered in bandages. He told the LA Times: 'They quickly took him away. It was surreal.' His friend, Steve Castro told\\xa0ABC News: 'It seems like there’s something behind it and, hopefully, we can get to the bottom of it.' Possible leads in the case include the unusual circumstances surrounding the lucrative deal he was believed to be on his way to completing. Another friend, Mytchell Mora, said: 'In particular on a Friday night, making that type of investment at 10, 11pm at night; that to me just didn’t sound like Kameron.' Mr Segal was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in critical condition. He is expected to make a full recovery. According to\\xa0KTLA, witnesses saw the suspect fleeing on a bike after the shots were fired. Installation: The windows on the $300,000 Rolls Royce Wraith are thicker so drivers and passengers inside the luxury vehicle are not subjected to noises from outside (file picture) The LAPD have now launched a manhunt for the shooter who was last seen wearing a baseball cap and carrying a ruck sack as he fled the scene . Authorities believe he is a black man in his late 30s to early 40s, is said to be around six feet tall and was last seen wearing a baseball cap and carrying a ruck sack. Aerial footage of the scene showed fire engines and patrol cars surrounding the vehicle which has suicide doors - where the hinges are at the rear rather than the front. Mr Segal is the CEO of Williams Holdings property and acquisitions, one of the largest apartment complex owners in LA. He was interviewed by News 11 in 2013 after he installed solar panels on buildings throughout the city. In December 2013 he surprised a homeless woman who had lost her job by giving her an apartment for Christmas. A man matching the description of the suspect was taken into custody nearby but was later released. On the scene: Segal (pictured left in a photo shoot and right at a party) is prominent on LA's party scene . Gathering: He is pictured (center) celebrating with a group of friends in May 2012 .\",\n",

One of Britain’s corporate giants warned yesterday that it may leave Scotland rather than risk the economic chaos that could be triggered by independence. Standard Life, a fund manager that looks after nearly £250billion of investors’ money, said it will take ‘whatever action necessary’ to\\xa0 protect its customers. Based in Edinburgh since it was founded in 1825, the company has 3.7million customers in the UK – but only 10 per cent live in Scotland. The company, which employs 5,000 people north of the border, is establishing\\xa0 ‘additional registered companies’ in England into which it will transfer parts of its Scottish operations ‘if necessary’. First Minister Alex Salmond's plans for independence suffered a double blow as business raised concerns about its impact . Gerry Grimstone, chairman of Standard Life, said the company was ‘strictly apolitical’, but must act to protect its customers. ‘Scotland . has been a good place from which to run our\\xa0 business and to compete . around the world,’ he said. ‘We very much hope that this can continue. ‘But, . if anything were to threaten this, we will take whatever action . necessary, including transferring parts of our operations from . Scotland, in order to ensure\\xa0 continuity and to protect the interests of . our stakeholders.’ Standard . Life said it is worried about a number of ‘material issues’, such as . the currency that will be used in Scotland,\\xa0 membership of the European . Union and personal taxes. It . might even move its headquarters from Edinburgh to London as well as . many of its different businesses. A source told the BBC: ‘There is no . stock exchange up here [in Scotland] and we are not sure we would wish . to become a foreign-registered company on the London Stock Exchange.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was 'no wonder' that business were worried about independence . In . a second blow for Alex\\xa0 Salmond’s plans, Royal Bank of Scotland, . another large employer, raised its concerns over the possibility of a . ‘yes’ vote. In its financial results, it raised fears about the . ‘significant impact’ of independence on all aspects of the bank, . including its ability to raise money. The . credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s warned\\xa0 yesterday that ‘a . large part’ of Scotland’s massive financial services industry could run . for the exit. It said Scotland would be ‘hard-pressed’ to borrow money . as easily as it does today if it loses the pound, and described the . challenges of\\xa0 independence as ‘significant’. Danny . Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said he doubts that . Standard Life and RBS will ‘be the last’ to voice their fears about . independence. ‘These businesses are\\xa0 reasonably and fairly setting out . the consequences of the SNP’s dangerous, risky and unclear plans for . independence,’ he said. Nick . Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said the growing anxiety among . employers in Scotland should be no surprise given the SNP’s failure to . ‘spell out what they mean by independence’. Former . Chancellor Alistair\\xa0 Darling, who leads the anti- independence Better . Together campaign, said yesterday that independence will cost jobs. ‘This . is the reality of Scotland leaving the UK and losing the UK pound,’ he . said. ‘Companies like Standard Life rely on the strength, security and . stability of the UK.’ John . Swinney, the Scottish Finance Secretary, said: ‘We are very happy to . engage with the company [Standard Life] to address the issues raised and . we look forward to the company continuing to play its part in building . that strong Scottish economy in the future.’\",\n",

The Dutchman, who played at Elland Road between 1997 and 1999, follows Robbie Fowler in expressing an interest. Leeds are searching for a new manager following the sacking of David Hockaday last month and Hasselbaink, speaking to talkSPORT on Wednesday, played up his credentials. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has put himself forward for the vacant manager’s job at Leeds . He said: ‘Leeds United is a wonderful big club where I had two great years. If they want to talk to me, of course I would talk [to them]. ‘I’ve got experience, I know I could take the club forward and I know I can take the club back to where they need to go. ‘But what do Leeds United themselves want? That’s the most important question. How do they see things? ‘At the moment there are so many things going on they need to sort out first, or maybe they have already. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored 42 goals in 87 appearances for Leeds . ‘But if they want to talk to me, of course I would be interested. Who doesn’t want to manage Leeds United? It’s one of the 10 biggest jobs in the country.’ Owner Massimo Cellino returns from a trip to the United States on Thursday and will start to consider applicants. Hasselbaink, 42, only has one season of management experience with Belgian second division club Royal Antwerp, though he did have a spell as a coach at Nottingham Forest. He scored 42 goals in 87 appearances for the Yorkshire club during his two seasons there before moving to Atletico Madrid in Spain. Former Leeds striker Robbie Fowler has also expressed interest in the vacancy . Fowler, who turned out for Leeds between 2001 and 2003, has been pushed forward for the vacancy by intermediaries. The former Liverpool striker spent time as a player-coach at Muangthong United in Thailand and has been coaching back at Anfield with former favourites Steve McManaman and Rob Jones. Academy manager Neil Redfearn will be in charge for Saturday’s Sky Bet Championship trip to Birmingham City and Cellino said he has ‘not heard of anyone better to look after the team.’ However, the 49-year-old, who is entering his third spell in caretaker charge at the club, is understood to have reservations about taking the job on permanently. Cellino is keen to appoint a British coach and will be heartened that Steve Clarke, Tony Mowbray and Chris Hughton are among those in contention.',\n",

              "  {'content': \"One of Labour’s rising stars was last night accused of thwarting a mission to save the British doctor who died in a Syrian jail. The grieving family of Dr Abbas Khan, 31, claimed that Chuka Umunna – Dr Khan’s MP – told a delegation not to travel to Damascus to lobby for his release. Last night Streatham MP Umunna released a statement in which he insisted that he had done everything in his power to help Dr Khan. The family of Dr Abbas Khan, including mother Fatima and brother Afrozi, has said Labour MP Chuka Umunna stopped a delegation travelling to Syria to lobby for their son's release . Syrian officials, who have been accused of torturing the doctor, claimed that he ‘committed suicide’ by hanging himself with his pyjamas in the state interrogation centre in Damascus last week. The Syrian regime handed the body to the International Committee of the Red Cross yesterday, who took it by road to Beirut, from where it will be flown back to the UK. Mr Umunna, who is shadow Business Secretary, has said he did everything in his power to help Khan . The surgeon, who was a specialist registrar at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore, North-West London, went to the Turkish-Syrian border in October 2012 to treat wounded refugees. He then crossed the border into Syria and began working in a field hospital in the war-ravaged city of Aleppo treating civilians. He was arrested within 48 hours by government forces as he did not have a valid visa. His arrest came at a time when hundreds of Britons were suspected of entering Syria to join Al Qaeda. No evidence has emerged that\\xa0 Dr Khan had any involvement\\xa0 with militants. Dr Khan’s sister Sara, 24, said that her family had expected Mr Umunna to discuss Dr Khan’s case with David Cameron. ‘He could have got my brother released much earlier as he could have pressed the Foreign Office to help,’ she said. Another member of the Khan family described Mr Umunna as a ‘chicken MP’. Dr Khan died just days before a delegation of British parliamentarians were due to visit Damascus to secure his release. The family say the group was initially due to fly out last month, but accused Mr Umunna of ‘sabotaging’ the plan by warning MPs about the safety risks. Labour MP Dave Anderson, who was going to lead the delegation, confirmed that he was advised by Mr Umunna not to travel. Mr Anderson said: ‘I then took further advice from a number of people, friends of mine who have got interests out there, and they said I would be OK.’ Outspoken MP George Galloway, who was involved in negotiating for the release of Dr Khan, said of Mr Umunna: ‘He was the dog which didn’t bark. Dr Khan was imprisoned in Syria after going to treat wounded civilians and was due to be released before the Syrian government claimed he hung himself . 'I don’t know why he was reluctant to get involved... Was it because of the false tittle-tattle around Parliament that Abbas was a Jihadi? I hope not.’ Mr Umunna said in a statement: ‘For over 12 months now I have\\xa0 been in contact with members of\\xa0 his family and the Foreign Office, doing what I can to assist the family as they have tried to secure\\xa0 his release.’ The Foreign Office said: ‘We consistently sought consular access to Dr Khan and information on his detention. These requests were consistently ignored.’ Last night Dr Khan’s mother, Fatima, 57, was seen leaving the morgue in Beirut where her son’s body was being kept. Clearly distressed, she said: ‘They’ve killed my baby.’ The body was later transferred to the British Embassy in Beirut and was due to be flown to the UK today. As Dr Khan’s body was driven out of Syria yesterday a British medical convoy of 50 ambulances were heading into the country from Turkey. Dr Abbas Khan, the British Muslim surgeon who risked his life to save women and children in the Syrian inferno, is far more than an isolated hero or martyr. He is a rallying figure – a symbol of all that is decent and humane in the vast majority of the Muslim population throughout the world. Hence his martyrdom must not be merely acknowledged as an independent incident; he should be elevated into a figure of world importance. Dr Abbas Khan was due to be released on Friday after being arrested in Syria last year . His name should be perpetuated posthumously, perhaps by awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize, or putting his name to an institute for research on human rights, conflict resolution or countering radicalism. It would be a fitting tribute. I believe that the terrible story\\xa0 of his imprisonment, which included sadistic treatment and torture, demands a clear and uncompromising attitude from all who wish to avenge it and prevent continuing practices of this kind. World opinion must reflect the fact that Dr Khan represents the best in universal values while at the same time intensifying an implacable and merciless fight against Jihadism and extremism. There must be no excuses for slacking in this respect. The treatment of this family man, tortured and killed in prison, defies description. I resent people telling me that it is something from the Middle Ages; it is not. The Middle Ages included some highlights of civilisation. No, this is the Stone Age plus technology. Dr Khan’s appalling case destroys the myths of the Islamophobes. It shows everyone that Muslims are on the same side as the rest of us in the fight for humanity and against extremism. This is not an argument based on partisanship for Israel, or a fear that Israel is threatened. Jihad threatens other Muslims and non-Muslims even worse than it does the Jews because they can look after themselves. Israel can ward off these attacks. But the rest of the world is not sufficiently protected because it is confused. The media has a crucial role in pointing out this international threat, a role it has not yet played. Dr Khan’s death must therefore be a clarion call to ensure there are no limits in the fight against Jihadism. Day before his death Khan wrote to his family, including son Abdullah, saying he wanted to come home . When you look at the excesses of the SS, or the Soviet torturers, even they were less brutal than the Jihadists, and less dangerous for one good reason: the Jihadist thinks he’s got God in his pocket. The Nazis and the Communists had Hitler and Stalin to look up to but the Jihadists claim to speak in the name of God, whether it be through their suicide bombers or their executions or their punishment amputations. One cannot help feel that the so-called compromise over the dismantling of Syria’s chemical weapons, brokered by Putin and accepted by Obama, is immoral. It ensures for Assad immunity from either military intervention or support in favour of the opposition – purely in exchange for the surrender of a chemical arsenal. An analogy would be the police saying to a mass murderer: ‘Look, if you’re prepared to show us where you keep your really sophisticated weaponry we promise that you can carry on killing in the old traditional way.’ In effect it means that Assad can continue undisturbed, supported by Russian and Iranian arms, to massacre women and children and almost certainly achieve victory. 'One cannot help feel that the so-called compromise over the dismantling of Syria's chemical weapons, brokered by Putin and accepted by Obama, is immoral' Numerous voices from the opposition are now expressing their regret at ever having taken up arms in the light of the failing support from the free world. Of course, the very convincing argument now put forward is that Assad is no worse – in some ways he may be better – than the radical extremists he is fighting. Today the situation is so terrible we don’t know which side is worse. But the point must be made that all this might have been prevented had the West, notably Obama, intervened at the outset; for instance, imposing a no-fly zone and guarding the porous frontiers against the influx of such extreme elements as Al Qaeda. The least we should achieve\\xa0 now in honouring the memory of Dr Abbas Khan is to ensure that the barbarous acts against him and others are treated as a priority by all mankind. We must not hesitate in our battle against extremism.\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'World powers beefed up financial and moral support for the Libyan opposition Thursday at an international coalition meeting aimed at charting the course of a post-Moammar Gadhafi Libya. Talk at the meeting in the United Arab Emirates focused on sustaining pressure on the embattled Libyan leader. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said \"numerous and continuous discussions\" on a transition of power were taking place among people close to Gadhafi. A spokesman for a Libyan opposition group told CNN that Gadhafi\\'s son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, was the primary negotiator for an exit plan for his father, but suggested the timing of the talks might not be good. \"I\\'m not sure there\\'s a lot of people willing to listen right now,\" said Mohammed Ali Abdallah of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya. Abdallah said a southern front had opened up in the fighting and that Gadhafi\\'s days were numbered. \"We are in the final phases,\" Abdallah said. \"Gadhafi\\'s military power has significantly been reduced. He is basically rattled.\" Clinton announced an additional $26 million in U.S. aid for the victims of Libya\\'s ongoing war and said time was on the international coalition\\'s side so long as Gadhafi faced sustained pressure. \"The violence must stop,\" she said. \"Gadhafi must go.\" Britain\\'s minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Alistair Burt, concurred: \"Gadhafi\\'s regime is crumbling,\" he said in a statement. \"He has lost all legitimacy and must go immediately.\" Promises of financial assistance flowed at the meeting, the third the international Libya group has held since war erupted. Italy pledged up to $580 million to the Libyan opposition\\'s Transitional National Council -- which is facing a budget shortfall -- to cover its expenses, but not weapons, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Maurizio Massari said. And Kuwait is donating the $180 million it promised in April for humanitarian needs, said Sheikh Mohammed Sabah al Salman al Sabah, the Gulf nation\\'s deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs. France, Italy and Qatar are among a small number of countries that have recognized the Transitional National Council as the legitimate government of Libya. While the United States has yet to officially recognize the rebel government, President Barack Obama \"has invited them to open an office in Washington,\" a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Clinton to the meeting in Abu Dhabi. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as a matter of practice for a press background briefing. In Washington, Obama\\'s choice to lead the Defense Department, Leon Panetta, warned Thursday that if Gadhafi survives as leader of Libya, it could undermine American credibility. \"I think it impacts on our national security interests in the world if that happens,\" Panetta said at his Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing. The Obama administration has resisted congressional efforts to end or rein in the Libya mission, which started in March. The Abu Dhabi conference got underway as Gadhafi\\'s forces launched a new attack against the rebel-held port city of Misrata, the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting in the months-long civil war that has killed thousands of civilians. The assault followed intense NATO bombardment of the capital, Tripoli. The alliance intervened in the conflict in March under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians as Gadhafi tried to crush the armed revolt against him. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN Thursday that the alliance has carried out more than 10,000 airstrikes that have damaged or destroyed more than 1,800 military targets, and have \"considerably degraded Gadhafi\\'s war machine.\" Rasmussen predicted the end was near for Gadhafi. \"Well no one knows exactly what will be the endgame, but I think the endgame is approaching, and this is the reason why we have strongly encouraged international organizations -- and notably the United Nations -- to speed up the preparations for that day,\" he said. But Gadhafi has vowed not to step down. \"We will not surrender,\" he said this week during a live audio broadcast as NATO warplanes bombed his Tripoli compound. In Misrata, rebels reported intense shelling by Gadhafi\\'s forces from three sides. It was the bloodiest day of fighting in a week, said Dr. Khaled Abu Falgha, a spokesman at Misrata\\'s Hekma hospital. Rebel spokesman Ibrahim Beit-elmal said Gadhafi forces failed Wednesday in their attempt to enter the city on the three front lines. He said the rebels had gotten most of their weapons by taking them from Gadhafi forces \"as spoils of war.\" Beit-elmal said Gadhafi\\'s latest tactic has been to send girls to join the front-line fighting. \"We arrested three, then let them go,\" he said. He said a high-ranking officer defected this week from Gadhafi\\'s forces and joined the rebel forces on the front. In all, he said, 15 of Gadhafi\\'s officers have surrendered and joined the rebel forces. In Zlitan, fighters attacked Gadhafi forces Thursday, taking four of their vehicles, but they failed to establish complete control, he said. This week, 22 rebel fighters were killed in the fighting, with many others wounded -- including 45 who were injured Wednesday, he said. Most of the casualties occurred on the western and eastern front lines. More than 100 members of Gadhafi\\'s forces were killed Wednesday, half of them on the southern front (of Abdul-Rauf), said Fathi Bashaagha, Misrata military-NATO coordinator. More than 1,000 people are believed to have been killed since fighting began there in early February, including 686 civilians who lived in the city, he said. Misrata has been under siege for months by Gadhafi\\'s forces, who have cut off all land access. The only escape route is by sea. The Transitional National Council, based in the de facto rebel capital of Benghazi in eastern Libya, has been seeking international support, including money, in its battle to oust Gadhafi. Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court\\'s chief prosecutor said a decision was expected within days from judges at the Hague on whether to charge Gadhafi and two others with crimes against humanity. Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is seeking the arrest of the Libyan leader and two relatives -- his son Saif al-Islam and brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi -- accusing them of \"widespread and systematic\" attacks on civilians as they struggle to hold power. Moreno-Ocampo told CNN that investigators have evidence that Gadhafi ordered rapes as part of his campaign to hold on to power. He said Libya\\'s acts of brutality were not the works of low-level soldiers, but that orders were coming from the top. The arrests the court is seeking, Moreno-Ocampo said, would \"stop the rapes, stop the killings, stop the torture.\" CNN\\'s Nic Robertson, Charley Keyes, Jamie Crawford, Jenifer Fenton and Max Foster contributed to this report.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'The pilot who landed a crippled US Airways jetliner on the Hudson River thought there would have been \"catastrophic consequences\" if he tried to make it to a nearby airport, a National Transportation Safety Board official said Saturday night. US Airways Flight 1549 remained in the icy Hudson River on Saturday. Instead, pilot Pilot C.B. \"Sully\" Sullenberger decided to ditch the plane in the Hudson River close to vessels moving about the water \"to improve chances of recovery,\" NTSB board member Kitty Higgins said. It was the first time the public heard comments from Sullenberger and first officer Jeffrey B. Skiles describing Thursday\\'s emergency landing. Skiles was flying US Airways Flight 1549, bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, when he noticed a flock of birds less than 90 seconds after the plane had taken off from New York\\'s LaGuardia International Airport, Higgins said. In an instant, the plane was rocked by loud thuds and both engines went out, Higgins said.  Watch the plane hit the water » . \"He commented on the formation, and he said the next thing he knew, the windscreen was filled with birds. There was no time to take evasive action,\" Higgins said. Sullenberger took control of the aircraft while Skiles began complicated procedures to try to restart the engines, Higgins said. Sullenberger thought the plane was moving \"too low, too slow\" to risk returning to LaGuardia through the maze of buildings. Nor did Sullenberger think the powerless aircraft could make it over the densely populated New Jersey area to Teterboro, Higgins said. \"There could be catastrophic consequences if we didn\\'t make it,\" she quoted Sullenberger as saying.  Watch CNN\\'s Lisa Sylvester report on the pilots » . City officials, passengers and aviation experts have lauded Sullenberger and the flight crew for their handling of the landing and also praised first responders who acted quickly to minimize passengers\\' injuries in below-freezing temperatures. All 155 people on board the plane survived. \"These are both very experienced pilots. They knew what they had to do,\" Higgins said. Neither Sullenberger nor Skiles attended the news conference. Earlier in the day, the NTSB revealed the content of communications between the cockpit and controllers at LaGuardia in the brief period during which the incident unfolded. \"This is cactus 1549, hit birds, we lost thrust in both engines,\" Sullenberger told controllers at approximately 3:27 p.m. Thursday. \"We\\'re turning back towards LaGuardia.\" Controllers immediately began preparations to clear a runway for an emergency landing, but less than a minute later, Sullenberger reported that the aircraft wouldn\\'t make it, Higgins said. The last communication from the plane to controllers, Higgins said, was the pilot saying, \"We\\'re gonna be in the Hudson.\"  Watch a former pilot tell how to water-land a plane » . Higgins also quoted two of the flight\\'s attendants, who were in jump seats at the front of the aircraft when they heard a loud thud shortly after takeoff. \"It was a sound that neither one of them had ever heard before,\" Higgins said. \"They said all the engine noise ceased. They described it as complete silence, like a library.\" Efforts to raise the jetliner from the river proved successful late Saturday, as cranes lifted it clear of the water about 11:30 p.m. ET following several hours of work by crews in frigid conditions. Video from the scene showed the right side of the aircraft with the engine intact but its covering mangled. It was not clear visually whether the damage was from an in-flight incident or from the landing impact. Investigators planned to tow the plane on a barge to an undisclosed location for their examination.  Watch water wash over the plane » . Searchers using sonar think they have found the left engine on the river bottom. Divers will try to confirm the finding, Higgins said.  Watch workers begin the retrieval process » . The flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- both crucial to determining exactly what happened Thursday -- remained on the aircraft, which was still largely submerged in the Hudson River but was secured to moorings. Strong currents and cold water thwarted divers\\' efforts to retrieve the recorders from the tail section of the jetliner, Higgins said. Also Saturday, authorities released audio and transcripts of two 911 calls from people who said they saw that the plane was in trouble.  Listen to callers report plane in the river » . One caller said he saw the plane descend and reported hearing a loud noise shortly after the aircraft took off. \"Oh, my God! It was a big plane, I heard a big boom just now. We looked up, and the plane came straight over us, and it was turning. Oh, my God!\" a man calling from the Bronx told a 911 operator at 3:29 p.m., three minutes after the plane left LaGuardia. Minutes later, at 3:33 p.m., a woman called 911 and reported seeing the plane in the water. \"A plane has just crashed into the Hudson River,\" she told an operator. \"A US Air big DC-9 or -10 has crashed into the Hudson River. ... Oh, my gosh!\" CNN\\'s Mike Brooks, Jeanne Meserve, Richard Davis and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.',\n",

And just days after Professor Hawking warned that 'artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,' a team of British researchers are embarking on a collaborative project to ensure that the autonomous robots we build in the future will make decisions that are ethical and can follow rules. Robots that can think and act without human intervention are fast moving from fiction to reality. There are fears that intelligent robots (illustrated) could one day overthrow humans, so a team of\\xa0British researchers are embarking on a collaborative project to ensure that the autonomous robots we build in the future will make decisions that are ethical and can follow rules . The nuclear, aerospace, manufacturing and agricultural industries are starting to develop autonomous systems that can carry out tasks that are either too difficult or too dangerous for humans, while driverless cars are already with us. Researchers at the Universities of Sheffield, Liverpool and the West of England, Bristol have set up a new project to address concerns around these new technologies, with the aim of \\xa0ensuring robots meet industrial standards and are developed responsibly. The £1.4 million project will run until 2018. Professor Michael Fisher, principal investigator at Liverpool, said the project will ‘develop formal verification techniques for tackling questions of safety, ethics, legality and reliability across a range of autonomous systems.’ Stephen Hawking has warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to be the downfall of mankind. 'Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history,' he said writing in the Independent. 'Unfortunately, it might also be the last' Google has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence. The . search giant has recently bought several robotics companies, along with . Deep Mind, a British firm creating software that tries to help . computers think like humans. One . of its founders warned artificial intelligence is 'number one risk for . this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction . 'Eventually, . I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will . likely play a part in this,' DeepMind’s Shane Legg said in a recent . interview. Among all forms . of technology that could wipe out the human species, he singled out . artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number 1 risk for this century.' The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused. Neuroscientist . Demis Hassabis, 37, founded DeepMind two years ago . with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans. The news may be a relief to scientists such as Professor Hawking, who last week warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.' Last month, Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind Space-X and Tesla, warned that the risk of ‘something seriously dangerous happening’ as a result of machines with artificial intelligence, could be in as few as five years. He has previously linked the development of autonomous, thinking machines, to ‘summoning the demon’. Speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AeroAstro Centennial Symposium in October, Musk described artificial intelligence as our ‘biggest existential threat’. He said: ‘I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence. ‘I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish. Last month, Elon Musk (pictured), the entrepreneur behind Space-X and Tesla, warned that the risk of ‘something seriously dangerous happening’ as a result of machines with artificial intelligence, could be in as few as five years . ‘With artificial intelligence we’re summoning the demon. You know those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he’s sure he can control the demon? Doesn’t work out.’ In August, he warned that AI could to do more harm than nuclear weapons. The three ‘laws of robotics’ were devised by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov in a short story he wrote in 1942, called ‘Runaround’. They state: . As part of the new research project, the University of Liverpool will focus on the development of ‘verification tools’ that will provide mathematical proof about the decisions the intelligent systems will make, allowing experts to check up on future machines’ actions. Researchers at Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL), a collaboration between UWE and the University of Bristol, will work on developing and demonstrating ‘ethical’ robots. Professor Alan Winfield, of the BRL, explained: ‘If robots are to be trusted, especially when interacting with humans, they will need to be more than just safe. ‘We’ve already shown that a simple laboratory robot can be minimally ethical, in a way that is surprisingly close to Asimov’s famous laws of robotics. ‘We now need to prove that such a robot will always act ethically, while also understanding how useful ethical robots would be in the real world.’ The three ‘laws’ were devised by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov in a short story he wrote in 1942, called ‘Runaround’. They state that a robot may not injure a human, or allow us to come to harm, must obey orders given by humans – unless breaking the first law – and must protect its own existence where possible. Professor Sandor Veres of Sheffield Robotics added: ‘Our project will demonstrate the abilities of robotic systems to take decisions based on ethics, law and safety grounds and provide further guidance to legislators and robot developers.’\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'Police arrested Indianapolis Colts safety Joe Lefeged early Saturday after allegedly finding his semiautomatic pistol poking out from under the passenger seat of the white Camaro he\\'d been in, police said. The Chevrolet sports car got police\\'s attention shortly after midnight because it was being driven erratically, Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Araz Alali told CNN. According to charging papers filed in D.C. Superior Court, police spotted one of its passengers standing up in the backseat of the convertible. On the street, plainclothes officers repeatedly asked the Camaro\\'s driver to put the car in the park. Instead, according to the charging papers, he put his foot on the gas and sped away. Four officers eventually found the Camaro, its still unidentified driver having fled on foot. They also saw one man, later identified as Lefeged, running in one direction and the man who\\'d been standing up in the Camaro, later identified as 23-year-old Aaron Timothy Wilson, going another way. Both men were arrested, about four miles east of the Capitol, without incident, according to Alali. Lefeged\\'s public defender, Martina King, gave a different take, saying her client was sitting in the Camaro\\'s passenger seat, not on foot, when he was arrested. Police at the scene searching the vehicle found a clear bottle in the center console that smelled of alcohol and a black H&K .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol \"in plain view sticking out from underneath the front passenger seat.\" Investigators determined that Lefeged paid $900 for the gun, which he took possession of in late May, according to the charging papers. King, the public defender, contended the gun in question is registered to Lefeged and, since it was under his seat, was out of his reach. But Judge Anne O\\'Regan Keary disagreed, saying that the firearm was in Lefeged\\'s reach if it was under his seat. Keary ruled that there was probable cause to continue detaining him at least until his next hearing Tuesday morning. According to Alali, Lefeged and Wilson were both arrested on suspicion of carrying a firearm without a license, having an unregistered firearm, having unregistered ammunition, presence of a firearm in a motor vehicle and possession of an open container of alcohol. For the time being, at least, Lefeged is facing only two charges: presence of a firearm in a motor vehicle and possession of an unregistered firearm. The 25-year-old Colts defensive back did not enter a plea during his initial court appearance in D.C. Superior Court on Saturday. Washington has some of the strictest gun-control measures in the country. According to the district\\'s law, \"no person shall carry within the District of Columbia either openly or concealed on or about their person, a pistol, or any deadly or dangerous weapon capable of being so concealed.\" That said, a firearm is permitted in the district if it is held in the registrant\\'s home or workplace, is being used for \"lawful recreational purposes\" or \"is being transported for a lawful purpose.\" Firearms registered elsewhere still must be registered in the District of Columbia. The Colts issued a statement Saturday after Lefeged\\'s arrest, saying little more than they were \"aware of the reports\" and will not comment further until they get additional information. Lefeged has played in every game of his two-year professional football career, including four starts last season for the Colts. His arrest comes a few days after another NFL standout, former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, was charged with murder and several gun-related offenses in the death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd.

              "  {'content': 'A drug counselor at California high school pleaded not guilty Wednesday to secretly videotaping students engaged in sexual activity with each other, and to possessing child pornography. Gilbert Olivares, 34, turned himself in late Monday, according to his attorney and the Salinas Police Department. His bail was set at $1 million. He entered his plea in Monterey County Superior Court to 19 felony charges brought by the district attorney. Allegations include lewd act upon a child, contact with a minor for sexual offense, possessing child pornography and using a minor to do or assist prohibited acts, according to the criminal complaint. Olivares\\' attorney, Andrew G. Liu, said he could not comment on specifics of the charges and his client\\'s stance. \"We are at a very early stage,\" Liu told CNN. \"I have just received 71 pages of police reports and I have not had time to review them yet.\" Olivares was first arrested last week at Salinas High School, initially on 11 charges, according to authorities. Olivares posted $50,000 bail at that time and was released, according to police Sgt. Christopher Lane. The criminal complaint alleges Olivares inappropriately touched the buttocks of a 14-year-old, identified as John Doe. The two allegedly also had conversations via Facebook. On further investigation of items seized from the counselor\\'s home, detectives found 14 videos made by Olivares in his office at the high school, police said in a statement. \"The videos are of teenage students engaged in sexual activity with each other within Olivares\\' office, during school hours,\" the statement says. \"It appears the videos were taken without the knowledge of the victim students and Olivares is not in the room at the time. We continue to work closely with Salinas High School to help identify any possible victims in these cases.\" Police said the forensic search of Olivares\\' computer also yielded dozens of pictures and videos depicting child pornography. They are not believed to depict children who attended the school and were probably downloaded from the Internet, police said. A new arrest warrant on multiple charges was obtained Monday and bail was increased to $1 million. \"The bail is unusually high and that might be subject to challenge in the future,\" Liu said. Olivares\\' preliminary hearing was scheduled for April 5. \"He is innocent until proven guilty and we\\'re looking forward to a fair hearing in court,\" said the attorney. \"He has the strong support of a loving family.\" Olivares is employed by an organization that counsels youth on drug and alcohol abuse, police said. Although he worked as a counselor at Salinas High School for five years, he was not an employee of the school district.',\n",

Police are investigating a theory that the Victoria's Secret worker who suffered horrific acid burns to her face may have inflicted the injuries on herself. Naomi Oni, 20, spent a month in a burns unit and has been left partially blinded from what she claimed was an unprovoked assault by a woman wearing an Islamic niqab. The part-time model said she feared an unknown enemy was 'out to kill her' and wanted to die when she first saw the way her face had been disfigured. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Naomi Oni, 20, pictured with This Morning host Phillip Schofield earlier this month . Shocking: Naomi Oni was returning from a shift at Victoria's Secret in Stratford, when the attack happened . However, police are now investigating . whether the attack may have been self-inflicted after they seized her . computer and found she had searched websites about acid attacks before . she suffered her injuries. She is believed to have researched . Katie Piper, a model who became famous for her bravery after she had . sulphuric acid thrown in her face by an ex-boyfriend in 2008. Miss Oni said she is 'really upset' about the allegation. Her family have accused the police of not doing . enough to catch the true perpetrator and wasting time by instead . focusing on a 'crazy' line of enquiry. Miss Oni was severely scarred on . December 30 following a shift working at lingerie store Victoria's . Secret at the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford, East London. Campaigner: Miss Oni is understood to have researched high profile acid attack victim Katie Piper before she was attacked herself . She said she was getting off a bus . close to her home in Dagenham, Essex, at around 12.40am when she noticed . a woman in traditional Muslim clothing, which covered all but her eyes, . 'coldly' staring at her from behind. She then felt something being thrown . at her, she added. 'Before I could feel it burning, I just knew it was . acid. I thought, OK, someone is out to kill me.' Miss Oni suffered horrific burns to . her face, leg, arm and head. She lost her hair and eyelashes in the . incident and has undergone several operations since. Doctors had initially feared that she . would be permanently blinded but following intensive treatment at a . specialist burns unit, she recovered sight in her left eye and partial . sight in her right eye. Miss Oni's story was first reported earlier this month after she went public in a bid to help police find her attacker. She made an emotional appearance on ITV's This Morning, for a reported fee of £3,000. 'I don't want people to see me in . public. I don't want to get the Tube or the bus. If I have to go to the . hospital, I take a taxi,' she said. 'I have no clue why someone would do . this to me.' Her case attracted much sympathy and top American cosmetic surgeon Cap Lesesne offered to operate on her for free. The incident has caused considerable . concern near her home and she and her mother have moved out temporarily . for fear of further attacks. Far right groups, such as the English Defence League, have used the attack to criticise Muslims. By the time she appeared on . television, police had reportedly sought to retrieve Miss Oni's laptop . computer, which was handed over by her disabled mother, Marian Yalekhue. It is believed she had searched . websites relating to acid attacks and the story of Miss Piper, 29, who . campaigns for victims of facial disfigurement. The pair were due to meet after Miss Oni's public appeal. Horrific injuries: Naomi Oni suffered burns to her face, head, arm and leg in an apparent attack in December . Officers have since questioned relatives about whether Miss Oni could have harmed herself. Miss Oni said: 'The police haven't . been able to find anyone. They even asked my aunt if I had done it to . myself, which really upset me. Why would anyone do this to themselves?' Friend Sheila Maclean said it was . 'innocuous' that Miss Oni may have watched a Channel 4 documentary about . Miss Piper on her computer, adding that this would simply have been due . to an interest in make-up. Miss Oni's boyfriend Ato Owede, 23, . said the police are 'concentrating on the wrong things' and 'are just . coming to a silly conclusion'. Police have yet to establish what kind of chemical was used in the attack. No arrests have been made. A spokesman for the Metropolitan police said officers 'continue to follow a number of lines of enquiry'\",\n",

Richard Backborow, Graham Waldren and Mat Thompson are pictured from left to right . The machine is endorsed by celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and is a cross between a bicycle and trike.

Mr Waldren said: ‘No-one has made any developments in steam technology for 200 years. ‘The motoring manufacturers are locked into what they are doing. The funding doesn’t exist for this. ‘Once we can put together the engine it will be a platform to demonstrate what we are doing and give us data.’ The bike can currently do around 25 miles for every 2.2lbs (1kg) of wood chips and takes about five minutes to start up. Mr Thompson explained: ‘It won’t replace the car, it might not work for bikes, but [it may work] for a small generator, for taking you off grid. The unusual bike is being put through its paces on the moors of Zennor in Cornwall (shown on this map) The trio of inventors hope one to day to see their biogas engine power homes and other devices. Here, they release a flame from the prototype engine . ‘We don’t have a lot of trees in Cornwall but there will be countries that could use this technology.’ The trio say renewable energy experts from the University of Exeter have expressed an interest in their designs. They are currently raising funds via the Crowdfunder website for further research into the so-called Phoenix Project, which is backed by River Cottage boss Fearnley-Whittingstall.

Brian Blackman, 73, was suffering from Parkinson’s disease and died in January 2011. A friend said it had a huge impact on his son, who tragically had been caught in traffic and unable make it to his father’s bedside to be with him as he died. It was against this emotional backdrop of regret and grief that the commando deployed to Afghanistan. Those close to him believe this played a part in the ‘moment of madness’ that ended in the execution of a Taliban fighter – and murder conviction more than two years later. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Alexander Blackman with his wheelchair-bound father Brian who died shortly before his tour of duty . Footage: The incident in which Blackman killed a Taliban militant was caught on camera by another Marine . Ironically, Blackman was a model soldier, a war hero with an exceptional record who had served in a number of conflicts. He proved his courage on six gruelling tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. And in 2001 he was part of the hunt for Bin Laden. He was among Marines flown in to help Special Forces as they fought Al Qaeda gunmen in Bora Bora. Blackman’s closest brush with death came on his tour to Iraq, when he miraculously survived being hit by a grenade during the assault on Basra. Identified: Sergeant Alexander Blackman has been revealed as the Royal Marine who was last month convicted a murdering an Afghan insurgent . Fighting had been intense, with an . officer describing the area as a scene from Dante’s Inferno. While . leading the assault on Basra, Iraq’s second city in a military vehicle, . his rucksack containing ammunition, water and rations was hit by the . warhead of a rocket propelled grenade in an ambush on his vehicle. Marines dived for cover as bullets and RPGs raining down on them, and one rocket smashed into his kit bag diverting it just past his head while bullets burst around them. After the attack, his fellow commandos could not believe that Blackman had not been killed. Despite the difficult campaign – which saw Marines locked in some of the fiercest fighting experienced by British forces – his combat report is said to have been ‘exemplary’ and he was recommended for promotion. His family in Brighton – his father, a former porter and lorry driver, his mother Frances, 74, a former hairdresser, brother and two sisters knew his love of the Marines and the lifestyle they offered. Blackman, a keen cyclist, runner and golfer, excelled while studying sports and physical education at Lewes Tertiary College in East Sussex. He had ambitions of representing Great Britain at canoeing until, aged 17, he was knocked down by a car while cycling. Desperate to challenge himself, he enlisted in the Royal Marines in 1998, passing the arduous tests with flying colours. Tours of Northern Ireland were followed by training in the US and Oman, and in November 2007 he deployed to southern Afghanistan. After returning from that tour he married Claire Warner, 38, an assistant director of operations with the National Trust in Somerset and Gloucestershire, and they settled in Taunton. Incident: The footage filmed by Marine B's helmet camera formed part of the court martial hearing . Revealed: Footage of the incident with Blackman's face uncensored has just been released for the first time . Highly regarded by senior officers, . Blackman had joined 42 Commando and J [Juliet] Company, known for its . discipline, fortitude and bravery – and members were tested to the full . during their six-month spring tour in spring 2011. He had previously seen some action in Afghanistan during the quieter winter months. But this deployment – later named the ‘Tour from hell’ by his colleagues – them attacked almost daily. Despite this hostility, the imposing 6ft 3in Blackman was credited with fostering ‘hearts and minds’ of the local population and helping oversee projects such as the building of a school. But the gruelling impact of losing friends and colleagues was to take its toll. During the proceedings leading up to his conviction for murder, Blackman said around 20 of his friends had been killed or maimed during the tour, including a popular young officer and a marine who had previously won a Military Cross for courage under fire. Film: The Marine could be heard quoting Shakespeare as he shot the Taliban prisoner . Trauma: Friends of Blackman have blamed the incident on the horrors he experienced while on duty . He said other comrades had suffered ‘life-changing’ injuries and described the effect the deaths had on commandos after the body parts of friends were hung in trees by insurgents. ‘It’s not a nice thing for the lads,’ he said. ‘Close friends they have lived with have been killed and parts of their bodies are displayed as a kind of trophy for the world to see.’ The Marines returned home as heroes, with Blackman earmarked for promotion to Colour Sergeant. It would have remained that way had a commando not been arrested by civilian police more than a year later and chilling head camera footage of the Helmand execution discovered on his laptop.\",\n",

We are going to nationalize the Banco de Venezuela.\" In a written statement issued Friday, Banco de Santander said it had planned to sell the bank to a Venezuelan private investors group, but \"found afterward that the Venezuelan government was interested in [acquiring] Banco de Venezuela, and conversations are under way to that effect.\"',\n",

The bodies and a car authorities said was used in the kidnapping of the girl were found in a heavily wooded area in Norman, outside Oklahoma City, said Jessica Brown, spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation. Lester Williams Hobbs, 46, was charged in the death of his estranged wife, Tonya, and the kidnapping of her daughter, Aja Daniell Johnson. Hobbs and the girl have been missing since January. Brown said the bodies are those of an adult and child, but positive identification has not been made due to decomposition. \"There\\'s no reason to believe it\\'s not\" Hobbs and the child, she said.

              "  {'content': 'The systems that control U.S. military drones have been infected with a computer virus, a U.S. defense official confirmed to CNN on Monday. Despite the infection of the classified program, the virus has not \"stopped flights worldwide,\" the official said. The official declined to comment on how the systems were infected nor whether the virus has resisted attempts to remove it. The infection was first reported by Noah Shachtman for Wired magazine last week. \"Military officials are more concerned than panicked by this virus. They\\'re just really not sure what\\'s going on. They\\'re not sure if it\\'s a deliberate attack. They\\'re not sure if it\\'s something accidental,\" he said. While drones are flown on missions in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, the actual \"cockpit\" of the unmanned aircraft is on U.S. soil -- the operators work at Nevada\\'s Creech Air Force Base. According to Wired, the virus, which records pilot key strokes, was first detected about two weeks ago. Tech specialists are unsure whether it was installed intentionally, Wired reported. Shachtman said the military has had a hard time wiping out the virus. \"They\\'re tried over and over again to get rid of this thing using some fairly conventional methods, and they haven\\'t worked. And so it seems the only thing to get rid of this virus is to basically wipe the hard drives of these computers entirely and sort of rebuild the computers from scratch,\" he said. But that can be an exhausting process. In 2008, removable hard drives introduced a virus into thousands of Defense Department computers, and to this day the Pentagon is still purging some machines. In the case of the computers that help coordinate the drones, care also has to be taken to back up all the information so it isn\\'t lost during rebuilding. U.S. drone strikes have been responsible for the deaths of dozens of suspected militants. In recent years, the United States has sharply increased its used of unmanned planes to target insurgents in Pakistan\\'s tribal region, a volatile area bordering war-torn Afghanistan. The covert CIA drone program has been deeply unpopular with many Pakistanis, who say the attacks kill civilians and violate their country\\'s sovereignty. In August, a drone attack killed al Qaeda No. 2 Atiya Abdul Rahman in Pakistan. The most recent high-profile drone strike resulted in the death of U.S.-born militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen last month. Unmanned aerial vehicles have become indispensable for military planners who depend on constant combat air patrols. But current and former Pentagon officials admit the technology cuts both ways. At the confirmation hearing for Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, former Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn said bluntly, \"In the 21st century, bits and bytes can be as threatening as bullets and bombs.\" He said even the National Defense University has been breached, and in a single intrusion this year 24,000 files were taken from a defense company. \"Some of the stolen data is mundane, like the specifications for small parts of tanks, airplanes and submarines. But a great deal of it concerns our most sensitive systems, including avionics, surveillance technologies, satellite communications systems and network security protocols,\" he said. Perhaps most alarming, Lynn admitted that up till now, the U.S. military had been unable to secure its systems. \"Current countermeasures have not stopped this outflow of sensitive information,\" Lynn said. \"We need to do more to guard our digital storehouses of design innovation.\" Officials have not yet determined whether the virus introduced into the drone program is benign, or doing actual harm. An investigation is ongoing. Despite the fact the controls are not linked into any outside network, and therefore seemingly impervious to intrusion, the drone systems do have security issues. Shachtman said they still use external hard drives, and when they\\'re attached to top-secret computers they can open them up to infection. He said the true danger of the virus comes not from an ability to \"bring down a drone,\" which is unlikely, but from an erosion of trust. If officials come to think that the information they\\'re receiving from the unmanned vehicles has been compromised, they\\'re much less likely to view it as safe and valuable, he surmised.',\n",

AbdulMutallab attempted to bring down Northwest Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, but luckily his underwear bomb didn\\'t detonate correctly. Khan had played more of a supporting role for AQAP as the editor of the group\\'s online magazine, Inspire, which has inspired a number of terrorists, including the two brothers suspected of bombing the Boston Marathon last year. The killings of two American citizens by a U.S. drone without a judicial process caused considerable outrage on both the left and the right. Since then there has been far more public discussion of the secretive drone program, both by U.S. government officials, including President Obama, and at public hearings about drones in Congress.  But will al-Awlaki and Khan be the last Americans to die in a U.S. drone strike? U.S. officials are now debating whether to kill with a drone another American citizen who is part of al Qaeda and believed to be plotting attacks against the United States, a senior U.S. official tells CNN. The Associated Press first reported this development but is withholding the name of the targeted individual. There has been speculation but no confirmation about who the individual might be. At least a couple of other American citizens or permanent residents are known to play important roles in al Qaeda today. One name that has been mentioned in media reports is that of California-born Adam Gadahn, who for the past decade has operated as a leading al Qaeda propagandist. In 2006 Gadahn was the first American charged with treason in more than half a century. However, there is, at least so far, no public information that Gadahn has played an operational role in al Qaeda\\'s terrorist plots, and therefore it is unlikely that he would be placed on a \"kill list,\" unless his role in al Qaeda has changed of late from propagandist to operational planner. According to a senior U.S. administration official, Gadahn is not the subject of the ongoing high-level discussions about whether a new name should be added to the kill list. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2013, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder laid out the legal rationale the government uses to determine if an American citizen can be killed in a drone strike. In the letter, Holder said that based on Supreme Court decisions during World War II, merely being an American citizen does not make one \"immune from being targeted.\" Holder also asserted that an American who poses an \"imminent threat of violent attack against the United States\" and is in a location where capture \"is not feasible\" could be killed. Holder explained that al-Awlaki \"plainly satisfied all these conditions\" as he had recruited the underwear bomber and instructed him to blow up an U.S. airliner \"when it was over American soil.\" Al-Awlaki was also killed in a remote part of Yemen where a U.S. ground operation to capture him was deemed unfeasible by the Obama administration. There is a certain irony in Holder\\'s legal reasoning. The FBI was monitoring al-Awlaki\\'s e-mail account for years before he was killed. To monitor his e-mail, the FBI had to get a court order. Yet the decision to target al-Awlaki for death was made without any kind of judicial proceeding.  As Vicki Divoll, a former assistant general counsel for the CIA, nicely put it a year before al-Awlaki was killed in the drone strike, \"Awlaki\\'s right to privacy exceeds his right to life.\" Khan was killed in the same drone strike that killed al-Awlaki, but according to a senior U.S. official, that was unintentional and was merely a byproduct of Khan traveling in the same car as al-Awlaki when the drone strike occurred. In sum, Khan\\'s role as the editor of Inspire magazine was not enough to put him on a kill list. When it comes to targeting a U.S. citizen for death, American officials, by their own account, will make particular efforts to determine how dangerous an al Qaeda operative that person really is. In the eyes of many Americans, however, a decision to kill one of their own should also be subject to judicial review.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Getting some sun on your skin not only improves your mood but could also reduce your blood pressure, say experts. A study found a strong link between low levels of vitamin D, absorbed by the body from sunlight, and higher levels of blood pressure. Researchers believe it is the first study of its kind to suggest that taking vitamin D supplements could be an alternative to drugs for tacking high blood pressure in some patients. Around 30 per cent of people in England have high blood pressure, known as hypertension, which is the single most important risk factor for early death. Antihypertensive drugs have common side effects such as coughing, dizziness, facial flushing and constipation, experts believe some people might benefit from vitamin D supplements instead . Lead researcher Professor Elina Hyppönen from the University of South Australia said ‘In view of the costs and side effects associated with anti-hypertensive drugs, the potential to prevent or reduce blood pressure and therefore the risk of hypertension with vitamin D is very attractive.’ Previously, a British study of more than one million patients found people with cancer diagnosed in summer and autumn lived longer than those diagnosed at other times of the year, probably because their vitamin D levels are topped up by sun exposure. The new findings come as debates rages over whether vitamin D plays a role in helping prevent disease, with conflicting scientific views. Although the vitamin is found in salmon, tuna and other oily fish, and is routinely added to milk, diet accounts for very little of the nutrient that actually makes it into the bloodstream compared with sun exposure. In a new study published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal researchers used genetic data from a database of 146,500 people across Europe and North America. They looked at particular genetic variants in the blood which affect levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood to establish the relationship with hypertension. The study found each ten per cent increase in vitamin D in the system was linked to lower blood pressure and an 8.1 per cent lower chance of suffering from hypertension. Because antihypertensive drugs have common side effects such as coughing, dizziness, facial flushing and constipation, experts believe some people might benefit from vitamin D supplements instead. Although the vitamin is found in salmon, tuna and other oily fish, and is routinely added to milk, diet accounts for very little of the nutrient that actually makes it into the bloodstream compared with sun exposure . Figures show three quarters of Britons have vitamin D intakes which are below recommended levels, with children and older people are at particular risk. In the UK, the Food Standards Agency does not recommend a specific daily dose of vitamin D unless you are elderly, pregnant, Asian, get little sun exposure and eat no meat or oily fish when 10mcg is advised. It says daily supplements of 25mcg are unlikely to cause harm. The danger with taking excessive doses for long periods is that the body absorbs too much calcium, which could weaken bones and possibly damage liver and kidneys. Earlier this year a major review found cancer patients with more vitamin D in their blood tended to have better survival rates and were in remission longer than those who were deficient. The findings came from analysis of 25 separate studies looking at vitamin D and cancer death rates.',\n",

But now, with dictator Kim Jong Un shelving plans for 2015 due to lack of funds for lack of funds, people will have to look elsewhere for entertainment. \\'It was billed as one of the biggest and most impressive performances in the world,\\' explains photographer Eric Lafforgue who attended the last Arirang Mass Games in 2013. \\'All over Pyongyang you could see  Arirang adverts talking about the \"grand mass gymnastic and artistic performances\" which the regime said even the opening ceremony for the Olympics couldn\\'t better.\\' Scroll down for video . Spectacular: The colourful Arirang Mass Games started life in 1946 and were initiated by Kim Il Sung . Kimilsungia: Dancers carry symbols of the Kim dynasty, in this case representations of the Kimilsungia - a type of purple orchid . Choreography: The Mass Games involve 100,000 performers, all either doing gymnastics or dancing . End of an era: Kim Jong Un has said the Mass Games won\\'t be held in 2015 - and possibly never again . But the future of the event, which began in 1946 and was last held in 2013, looks increasingly uncertain, with Kim Jong Un\\'s regime seemingly set on shelving the Arirang altogether. Designed to promote the Workers Party of Korea, the armed forces and the Kim dynasty, the Arirang Festival started life in 1946 and was, from the start, littered with regime iconography. Rising suns, which represent Kim Il Sung, feature heavily in the costumes, as do guns which are a reference to Sung passing \\'the struggle\\' on to his son Kim Jong Il and grandson Kim Jong Un. Flowers are a popular prop, with red representing workers and purple the Kim dynasty. Unsurprisingly, many are\\xa0Kimilsungia, a type of purple orchid, and\\xa0Kimjongilia, a crimson begonia. Big day: The event was held at Pyongyang\\'s main stadium and usually had a military flavour . Free pass: Soldiers were given free tickets to the event as a reward for good behaviour . Celebration: The military personnel were there to see the army - and the ruling Kim dynasty - celebrated . Practice: In the months leading up to the event, Pyongyang was the scene of regular drills . Getting it right: Instructors with loudspeakers told the massed ranks of gymnasts exactly what to do . Result: The colourful spectacle that ensued was the result of months of training . Symbolism: Many of the dances symbolised workers, with apples and girls in iridescent dresses seen here standing in for farmers . Tribute: Other tableaux focused on the Kim dynasty. These gymnasts are holding Kimjongilias - a type of crimson begonia . Colour symbolism: These sailors are followed by gymnasts holding Kimiljongias and purple fans - both representative of the regime . Kim\\'s colours: Clutching Kimjongilias and dressed in purple, these gymnasts are advertising their loyalty to the regime . Tough job: Many of the performers, in particularly the gymnasts, are drawn from local schools . Armed forces: Attractive female soldiers also play a big role in proceedings, their job to highlight the armed forces . Impressive: Another highlight of the Arirang Mass Games were the mass military parades - complete with giant flags . Popular: All members of the armed forces were represented, whether sailors, soldiers or pilots . But propaganda aside, what really makes the Arirang Mass Games stand out are the sheer numbers involved. \\'100,000 athletes took part in the show I saw,\\' explains Lafforgue. \\'Then, there were 20,000 teenagers sitting at the back of the stadium holding cards and making pictures. To make a soldier, 2000 of them were needed while it took all 20,000 to make a Korean flag.\\' Awe-inspiring though the sight was, Lafforgue says some of the people-art hints at North Korea\\'s more sinister ambitions. \\'Some of them showed atoms, which symbolise the nuclear bomb, while others showed the two Koreas together under the Kim dynasty\\'s rule.\\' The show also has a military flavour, with sexy female soldiers in uniforms and garters sent out to dance in front of troops, mostly men, who had been given a free pass to the show as a reward for good behaviour. Despite its massive scale, the Arirang lasts for just one hour with attendees going straight home afterwards. \\'All the thousands of people in the stadium just vanished into the streets,\\' Lafforgue recalls. \\'Pyongyang\\'s streets are really dark and quiet so the contrast with the stadium was almost shocking. It felt very unreal, like being in a terrifying and fantastic alternate universe.\\' Surreal: Whirling gymnasts in green and white combine to create a psychedelic scene . Well-rehearsed: A group of girls, all dressed in Kim dynasty purple, march en masse . Extraordinary: Thousands of performers take part in each Arirang Mass Games, although the future is now uncertain . One for the workers: The colour red is also used to symbolise the workers, Communism and the Kims . Pretty: Rows of dancers clutching fans designed to look like Kimilsungia orchids perform at the Mass Games . Unusual combination: Each segment combined dance and gymnastics with the marching military . Alternate universe: Photographer Eric Lafforgue says watching the performances was like being in a different universe . Elaborate: This scene references Kim Jong Il\\'s birth, which, according to North Korean myth, took place in a mountain log cabin . Showing allegiance: This tableaux features the Communist flag, complete with the hammer and sickle once used by the USSR (now Russia) Vast: The Mass Games take over Pyongang\\'s central stadium for the last time in 2013 .',\n",

Both Cherif Kaouchi, one of the brothers behind the massacre of 12 at the Paris satirical magazine and Ahmedi Coulibaly, who held up to ten hostage on Friday in a kosher supermarket, are graduates of the Buttes Chaumont gang – named after the Paris park where they were radicalised more than ten years ago. The revelations that Kaouchi and Coulibaly - both killed on Friday afternoon - were in contact with some of Europe's most notorious fanatics will only raise more questions of the French authorities' failure to stop Wednesday's atrocity at Charlie Hebdo's office and the carnage that has followed. Scroll down for video . Mentor: Djamel Beghal, a key al Qaeda leader of recruited terrorists while worshiping at London's Finsbury Park Mosque, met Cherif Kaouchi and Ahmedi Coulibaly in prison in France . Hatred: Beghal was linked to many known terrorists - including hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza . Notorious: Kouachi was mentored by terrorist Beghal, who has links to London's Finsbury Park mosque . Until this week, the Buttes Chaumont gang was a name which appeared to have drifted into relative obscurity. But in the early 2000s, members of the gang were considered 'pioneers' of the foreign jihadi movement,\\xa0raising money for terrorist attacks and sending fighters to Iraq. Named after a park in the 19th arrondisement, the members were young and disaffected: Cherif has been described as a 'loser' working as a pizza delivery boy during the period into drugs, girls, petty crime and alcohol. They appear to have first come to the notice of the police during protests against the Iraq war; later, members would be jailed for a range of offences linked to terrorism. And it was while in prison that both Cherif and Coulabily found a new mentor:\\xa0Djamel Beghal, a key al Qaeda leader of recruited terrorists when he worshipped at London's Finsbury Park Mosque. Former MI5 informant Reda Hassaine described Beghal as a 'constant presence' at Finsbury Park Mosque in the late 1990s. He said he was particularly close to extremist preacher Abu Qatada, but also mixed in the same circles as Abu Hamza. Hamza was jailed for life by a New York court today after being convicted of international terrorist offences. But Benghal's influence was felt on both sides of the Channel, having lived in Leicester for several years after moving his family from France. Beghal is said to have recruited shoe bomber Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui, the '20th hijacker' in the attacks of September 11, 2001. He openly admitted  meeting Osama bin Laden as he recruited British jihadists to fight in Afghanistan, and was jailed in 2005 for plotting to bomb the US embassy in Paris. Prison pals: Chérif and Beghal pictured playing football together in 2010, after Cherif was released . Link: Cherif (left) and Coulibaly were both implicated in a plot to free\\xa0jailed Islamist Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem (right) Terror: Coulibaly was killed after French special forces raided a kosher deli where he was holding hostages . MI5 informant Reda\\xa0Hassaine told the Telegraph: 'There is no doubt that you can see the influence of their teachings in him. 'Their warped view of the world has filtered down through him to a new generation. 'What happened in Paris was the legacy of Abu Qatada and Abu Hamza. 'A completely new generation, who have never met these people in London, have learned their ideology indirectly and are now willing to die in jihad.' The two young men maintained contact with Benghal after being released from jail:\\xa0Cherif was secretly photographed by French intelligence officers meeting Beghal while he was under house arrest in Murat in central France in April 2010. According to French police reports, Coulibaly also made secret visits to Beghal's home after his release from prison. Cherif, who was jailed twice for terrorism-related offences, in 2005 and 2008, was photographed playing football and exercising with Beghal in prison by surveillance teams. But it was a plot to free another jailed Islamist\\xa0Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem which first clearly linked Coulibaly and Cherif. Both men were killed this afternoon after police stormed the supermarket and office where they had been holding hostages . Claimed links: Beghal allegedly recruited the shoe bomber Richard Reid (left) and Zacarias Moussaoui (right), the ‘20th hijacker’ in the 9/11 attacks, at the London mosque . Belkacem was a leading members of the Algerian terrorist group GIA, or Armed Islamic Army, and was behind the attack on a suburban station which left 30 people injured. Both men would be named suspects in the 2010 plan, while it would Beghal who would later be named as the person behind the failed scheme. However, it would be another member of Buttes Chaumont who gave the brothers the strongest link to what is now the world's most notorious terror network, Isis. Boubaker al-Hakim was a member of Buttes Chaumont, and was jailed alongside Cherif in 2008. Like Cherif, he lived in the 19th arrondisement, and became radicalised as a teenager. Hakim, who is of Tunisian origin, was to become a key figure in recruiting young French Muslims to fight in Iraq, and both he and Cherif \\xa0rejoined the al Qaeda network in Iraq on their release from prison. Boubaker al-Hakim (right) was a member of Buttes Chaumont, and is now a commander with Isis . Yet while Cherif seems to have kept a relatively low profile in the past few years, Hakim has risen to prominence as a fighter with Isis. He claimed responsibility for the 2013 murder of two Tunisian Left-wing opposition politicians, claiming responsibility for it in a video released by Isis last month. 'We will return and kill several of you,' he warned. 'You won't live in peace until Tunisia applies Islamic law.' Jean-Pierre Filiu, an expert at Sciences-Po University in Paris, told the Telegraph this link would have been crucial. 'It is impossible an operation the scale of the one that led to the massacre at Charlie Hebdo was not sponsored by Daesh [Islamic name for Isis],' he said. However, a witness quoted by Paris newspaper 20 Minutes as saying one of the assailants cried out before getting into his car: 'Tell the media that it is al Qaeda in Yemen!' This too is eminently possible, although this time is is Said who is believed to have strong links to the group, known as AQAP (al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula). Radical: Beghal attended the prayer meetings held by hate cleric Abu Qatada (pictured) in London . Said is said to have met leading the US-born al Qaeda preacher Anwar al Awlaki during a trip to the middle eastern country in 2011. The Yemeni source said Said, 34, was among a number of foreigners who entered the country for religious studies. 'We do not have confirmed information that he was trained by al Qaeda but what was confirmed was that he has met with Awlaki in Shabwa,' the source said, noting that he could have been trained in one of the large parts of Yemen not under the control of the authorities back in 2011. AQAP emerged as one of al Qaeda's most aggressive international affiliates and a direct threat to the United States, when it claimed responsibility for an attempt by a Nigerian man, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, to down a Detroit-bound airliner on December 25, 2009 with a bomb concealed in his shoe. It said it was also behind a foiled plot to send two air freight packages containing bombs to the United States in October 2011. However, Awlaki- who was seen as an influential international recruiter to the al Qaeda movement - had been killed the month before in a drone strike widely attributed to the CIA. The mass murder at Cherif Kouachi's hands appears to have taken the French security services by surprise. There are suspicions he may have been written off as a 'failed jihadist' after reverting the low-level crimes and chaotic lifestyle of his youth. Experts suspect a French-Tunisian jihadist now fighting for ISIS could link Cherif Kouachi and Islamic State militants occupying swathes of Iraq and Syria. Boubaker al-Hakim claimed responsibility last month for assassinating two politicians, Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi, in Tunisia in 2013. Al-Hakim was previously part of the Butte Chaumont network alongside Kouachi and experts believe Islamic State must have played some role behind the sophisticated attack. Jean-Pierre Filiu, of Paris's Sciences Po university, said it is 'certain' that Islamic State is following events closely and may well be preparing a video claiming responsibility. Suspicions that Islamic State were aware of the attack were heightened by a mysterious tweet by a jihadist 24 hours beforehand. Reading simply: 'snail eating people' it was followed by a second message 'you heard it here first #snaileaters ate lead' posted within hours of the shooting. In a further development, a senior intelligence source revealed Said Kouachi met Al Qaeda preacher Anwar al Awlaki during a trip to Yemen. The official said the terrorist suspect travelled to the country for 'several months' in 2011 with several other foreign fighters. Awlaki, who was killed in a drone strike in September of that year, is one of the most influential Islamist figures of modern times. His huge catalogue of videos and audio sermons remain a grim inspiration for Islamists in all corners of the world. The Yemeni source said: 'We do not have confirmed information that he was trained by al Qaeda but what was confirmed was that he has met with Awlaki in Shabwa.' The southern province of Shabwa is a lawless area where Al Qaeda militants and the security forces have clashed in recent years.\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"We can spend the next few years beating ourselves up and debating the proposition that George W. Bush saved Iraq and Barack Obama lost it. Or we can get real and try to sort out what we can do now to protect U.S. interests in a region that's melting down. Iraq was never the U.S.'s to win. That point -- along with lowered expectations and focused goals -- must be the basis of any new approach to the region. And here are three reasons. 1. Demography: There are two factors that nations -- even functional ones (and Iraq is not) -- can't alter: What they are -- their demography; and where they are -- their geography. Iraq has been dealt an unhappy hand in both departments. There is, to be sure, a sense of Iraq national identity. But at the same time the end of Saddam Hussein's cruel rule -- for which the U.S. is responsible -- opened up a Pandora's box of sectarian tensions and expectations -- for which the U.S. is partly responsible -- that have never been adequately addressed. In essence, the U.S. overturned a brutal minority Sunni rule and enabled Shia majority rule. The ins became the outs, and the outs the ins. And guess what? Despite several successful elections, $25 billion from the U.S. to train and equip the Iraqi military, and another trillion in support of the Nuri al-Maliki government, Iraq never equitably distributed political and economic power. Sunnis became disenfranchised, angry and vulnerable to jihadi persuasions; Shia sought to get even, get ahead and maintain a privileged position; and Kurds sought to protect their own interests and effectively create a separate governing authority. Iraq these days isn't so much a nation as it is a collection of battling sectarian groups, each seeking advantage at the expense of the Iraqi state. 2. Geography: Iraq's neighbors, particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia, do not share America's vision of an equitably balanced and independent polity. Each of them has its own vision. Iraq has become a pawn in a regional competition between Sunnis and Shia and Arabs and Persians. Iran wants a weak, stable Iraq not aligned with the West, under Shia influence. The Saudis want al-Maliki out and are happy that the militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria may provide that opportunity, even as they fear the jihadists. They want Sunnis empowered and Iran disempowered. Turkey has made its peace with the Iraqi Kurds and hopes to get them to moderate the radical tendencies of those in Syria, but really has no answer to the ISIS contagion. Jordan is vulnerable to ISIS too, but can't exercise much influence in Iraq. And that leaves Syria. The regime of Bashar al-Assad is aligned with both Iran and al-Maliki, and -- likely under Tehran's encouragement -- has begun to use military force against ISIS along the Syria-Iraq border. All this regional maneuvering reflects the reality that the neighbors' interests will continue to trump America's by virtue of their proximity, their influence in Iraq, and the reality that Iraq is more vital to them than it is to us. 3. Syria: Iraq can't be stabilized without dealing with Syria. And to date, the U.S. -- by default the only power that remotely has the capacity to alter the course of the civil war there -- has been unable and unwilling to do that. The ISIS threat may prompt a review of the Obama administration's Syria policy, but we should be under no illusions that Washington is ready to jump in with a comprehensive political, economic, and military strategy to end the conflict. Indeed, the United States will be faced with some tough choices. It may find itself in the odd position of ramping up support for the more moderate Sunni rebels in Syria but also striking ISIS. That means we will be trying to weaken al-Assad on one hand, but indirectly strengthening him on the other by attacking a common enemy. Under no circumstances should the Obama administration commit to trying to put two broken nations back together again. Bottom line is that the real challenge is ISIS, which is likely to remain ensconced in parts of Syria and Iraq. What should Obama do? First let's be clear about what he shouldn't do. The United States needs to abandon any illusions that it can transform or find an easy way out of the situation. It is stuck in a region that it can't fix or leave. There isn't a single problem in this region that has a comprehensive or definitive solution. Instead, the U.S. should accept the reality that it will be dealing with outcomes, not happy endings, there. Iraq may never be a unified polity, but it need not necessarily be a failed one. The question is, can we shape these outcomes to our advantage? Bush 43 tried to do too much; Obama too little. Is there a balance? The U.S. needs at least three different but related approaches: . 1. Coordinate with regional partners. Sure, in the case of Iran, it's like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop. But the U.S. can't begin to deal with ISIS on its own. Iran is the key external power in Iraq. And Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have a stake in stopping ISIS's advances. The U.S. may have to accept the reality that the evil al-Assad is a hedge against ISIS, even though his policies helped to facilitate its rise. 2. Think diplomacy first, then military force. You need the first to make the second effective. That coordination must try to produce a more acceptable political arrangement in Baghdad, with or without al-Maliki. Without the Iraqi government regaining Sunni support, ISIS will continue to roll. And this means some new and more inclusive political arrangement in Baghdad to share power. Forget democracy and making Iraq whole. To bring Sunnis around and check ISIS, we may have to not only concede influence to Iran but also to some pretty bad Sunnis, including former Saddam supporters and insurgents. 3. The U.S. will need to do what it can to buck up the Iraqi military. This could easily lead to sending additional advisers, but under no circumstances should it involve the use of combat forces. We may well have to use airstrikes and drones against ISIS. And this is tricky, because it risks feeding jihadi sentiment. That's why a new political arrangement is mandatory. But even without it, the United States must face the reality that ISIS -- with money, passports, and a base of operations -- will emerge as a threat to our friends in the region, to Europe and ultimately to us. We shouldn't run scared. ISIS's own ideology will produce a counterreaction among Iraqis who will oppose its harsh, unforgiving ideology. Indeed as the International Crisis Group points out, ISIS is its own worst enemy. The region is littered with the remains of failed jihadi efforts, including al Qaeda central. In 2013, there were 17,800 global fatalities as a result of terrorist attacks. Only 16 of those were Americans. Terror is not a strategic threat to the homeland right now. But it may well require a coordinated counterterror effort with our regional and international partners to prevent it from becoming one.\",\n",

Here are the key points:\\n\\n1. **Demography**: Iraq's diverse population, comprising Sunni, Shia, and Kurdish groups, has deep-seated sectarian tensions that the U.S. has struggled to address. Despite efforts to train and equip the Iraqi military and support the government, political and economic power has not been equitably distributed, leading to disenfranchisement and instability.\\n\\n2. **Geography**: Iraq's neighbors, particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia, have their own interests and visions for the region, often at odds with U.S. goals. Iran seeks a weak, Shia-influenced Iraq, while Saudi Arabia wants a Sunni-empowered state and Iran's influence reduced. Turkey and Jordan also have limited influence, and Syria's Assad regime, aligned with Iran, is using military force against ISIS along the Iraq-Syria border.\\n\\n3. **Syria**: Stabilizing Iraq is intertwined with resolving the Syrian civil war. The U.S. faces a dilemma in supporting moderate Sunni rebels while also combating ISIS, which indirectly strengthens Assad.

              "  {'content': \"Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moallem said his government was ready to work with any side, including Britain and the U.S., or join any regional or international alliance against the Islamic State group . Syria has said it is ready to cooperate with the international community to tackle Islamic State militants as it continues its civil war with various rebel groups. Foreign minister Walid al-Moallem said his government was ready to work with any side, including Britain and the U.S., or join any regional or international alliance against the Islamic State group. But he insisted any military action inside the country must be co-ordinated with Damascus, or else an attack would be considered as aggression. Al-Moallen added that airstrikes alone will not be enough to eliminate extremists groups such as the Islamic State and the Nusra Front. He called for 'drying up' their resources including cutting off funding and arming by regional state actors and private donations as well as controlling the borders and exchange of intelligence information. America's top general last night said he will only recommend military action against Islamic State militants in Syria directly if they become a threat to the U.S. homeland. General Martin Dempsey said that he still believes the insurgent group is more of a regional threat and is not planning any attacks against the U.S or Europe. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also said he believed key allies in the region, such as Jordan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, will join the U.S. in its battle against the group. Al-Moallem's remarks at a news conference in Damascus  marked the first public comments by a senior official of President Bashar Assad's government on the threat posed by the Islamic State group, which has captured large swaths of Iraqi and Syrian territory. 'Syria is ready to cooperate and coordinate on the regional and international level in the war on terror,' al-Moallem said. 'But any effort to combat terrorism should be coordinated with the Syrian government.' Al-Moallem's remarks at a news conference in Damascus marked the first public comments by a senior Assad official on the threat posed by the Islamic State group . He went on to say: 'Any strike which is not coordinated with the government will be considered as aggression.' President Barack Obama has resisted ordering U.S. military action in Syria for three years, even after a deadly chemical weapons attack a year ago near Damascus he blamed on President Assad's government. But now, Obama faces pressure from his own military leaders to go after the Islamic State group inside Syria. Obama remains wary, however, of getting dragged into the bloody and complex Syrian civil war that the United Nations says has killed more than 190,000 people. Western authorities now fear the Islamic State 'caliphate' could be used as a launchpad for global terror attacks - fears that were increased following the beheading of American journalist James Foley last week. An Islamic State video last week depicting the beheading of Mr Foley prompted revulsion in the West and calls for tougher action against the jihadists, including taking the fight to them in Syria as well as Iraq. Some experts have suggested that attacking Islamic State in Syria should involve coming to some sort of arrangement with the government of President Assad, seen in the West as a pariah since an uprising against him began three years ago. A man inspects damage at the entrance of the National Hospital of al-Tabaqa, caused by what activists said was an airstrike by forces of Syria's President Bashar Al-Assad on the hospital, beside al-Tabqa military base, west of Raqqa . Last week, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond insisted that Britain will not 'align' itself with President Assad to defeat IS fighters. Mr Hammond said Britain may have a 'common enemy' with the Syrian regime but added: 'That doesn't make us friends. It doesn't make us able to trust them, it doesn't enable us to work with them.' His remarks came after Lord Dannatt, the former Chief of the General Staff, said it was impossible to fight Islamic State terrorists in Iraq while allowing them to retain their stronghold in bordering Syria. The peer said Britain would eventually have to work with President Assad to defeat the insurgency by getting his approval for a bombing campaign in Syria. During today's press conference, al-Moallem \\xa0said the Syrian government had repeatedly warned of the threat of terrorism and the need to cut off resources and funding but 'no one listened to us.' Syria's government has long described the rebels fighting to topple Assad as 'terrorists' in a foreign conspiracy. U.S. officials revealed last week that U.S. forces had tried to rescue Mr Foley in a failed operation in Raqqa in July. General Martin Dempsey said last night that he still believes the insurgent group is more of a regional threat and is not planning any attacks against the U.S or Europe . 'Had there been prior coordination that operation would not have failed,' al-Moallem said. The minister also denounced 'in the strongest terms possible' Mr Foley's killing last week by Islamic State militants, while asking: 'Has the West ever condemned the massacres by the Islamic State and Nusra against our armed forces or citizens?' Al-Moallem's news conference came a day after jihadis captured a major military air base in northeastern Syria, eliminating the last government-held outpost in a province otherwise dominated by the Islamic State group. After several failed attempts, Islamic State fighters stormed the Tabqa air base Sunday, killing dozens of troops inside. Al-Moallem conceded defeat in Tabqa, saying that soldiers were withdrawn to nearby areas, along with their weaponry and warplanes inside the base. The Islamic State group has established a self-declared caliphate in areas straddling Iraq and Syria's shared borders. The United States began airstrikes against the group in northern Iraq earlier this month which have helped the Kurdish peshmerga to reclaim some lost territory. Lord Dannatt, the former Chief of the General Staff, has said it was impossible to fight Islamic State terrorists in Iraq while allowing them to retain their stronghold in bordering Syria . The United Nations meanwhile today condemned 'appalling, widespread' crimes by Islamic State forces in Iraq, including mass executions of prisoners that could amount to war crimes. U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay condemned 'grave, horrific human rights violations' being committed by Islamic State, a Sunni Muslim group which has seized large areas of Iraq and Syria to the alarm of the Baghdad government and its allies in the West. Up to 670 prisoners from Badush prison in the city of Mosul were killed by Islamic State on June 10, Pillay said in a statement quoting survivors and witnesses to the 'massacre' as telling U.N. human rights investigators. 'Such cold-blooded, systematic and intentional killings of civilians, after singling them out for their religious affiliation, may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,' Pillay said. Islamic State (ISIL) loaded 1,000 to 1,500 prisoners from the jail on to trucks and took them for screening, Pillay said. Sunni inmates were then separated and removed. 'ISIL gunmen then yelled insults at the remaining prisoners, lined them up in four rows, ordered them to kneel and opened fire,' she said.\",\n",

Great Britain's Hannah Cockroft was delighted after she broke her own world record with a stunning performance in the 200m T34 race on the opening day of the IPC Athletics Grand Prix in Nottwil, Switzerland. The 21-year-old multi-world and Paralympic champion powered past her previous best time by 0.37 seconds as she came home in 30.86secs to beat a strong field that included six of the eight finalists at the London 2012 Games. Cockfroft, from Halifax, said: 'It was great to post such a fast time in my first IPC Athletics Grand Prix of the season. I'm delighted with the record, although I know I can go faster looking at my training times. Record breaker: Cockroft beat her own world record by a margine of 0.37 seconds .

The 34-year-old Great Britain Paralympic champion lost out on first place after going head-to-head with home favourite Marcel Hug, who finished in 21 minutes, 16.21 seconds in the first leg of the season. Midway through the race, rivals Weir and Hug broke away from the rest of the field with Masayuki Higuchi of Japan, but with 200m to go, the Swiss powered to the front and crossed the finish line first with Weir just 0.10secs further back. Return: David Weir narrowly missed out on the win in the 10,000m but will be pleased with his performance . Weir, who has won a total of six gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Paralympic Games, and has won the London Marathon on six occasions, said: 'It was a good race. I don't do many 10,000m so it was nice to feel comfortable throughout the race. 'I wanted a British record but there were only three of us out there doing the work. But it was a good race. It felt like the old days with each of us taking it in turns leading the laps.' On Saturday, Hug and Weir line-up against each other again twice - first in the 800m during the morning session and in the eagerly anticipated 1,500m race during the evening.\",\n",

While Premier League stars park their supercars outside multi-million-pound mansions, Stephanie Houghton earns just £16,000 a year, shares a house with three girls and drives a Vauxhall Corsa. But the new sensation of women’s football is too busy enjoying her sport to be envious of her cosseted male counterparts. ‘The money doesn’t bother me – I just want to play football,’ the blonde 24-year-old told the Mail. Although she is a defender, Miss Houghton has scored in all three matches for Great Britain, helping the team to win their group. And today she will try to maintain her goal-a-game record when the team take on Canada in the quarter-finals at Coventry before a sell-out crowd. Miss Houghton became an instant celebrity after scoring the winner against Brazil at Wembley on Tuesday watched by a crowd of 70,000 – the biggest ever for a women’s football match in England. Such an audience would have been unthinkable a month ago, when many mocked the decision to kick-start the Olympics with women’s football and predicted half-empty stadiums. But Miss Houghton has helped to give the sport a prominence never seen before. Her followers on Twitter have soared from a couple of thousand to 20,556 in just a week and she has been declared the new poster girl for women’s football. The former shop assistant from County Durham is, however, not about to let her success go to her head. ‘I don’t actually know what’s happening at the moment,’ she said. ‘I am as surprised as anybody else, to be honest. The last week or so has just been amazing, absolutely unreal. ‘If somebody had told me before the tournament that I would score three times I would have told them they were having a laugh. It is just what every footballer dreams of.’ Miss Houghton grew up in the former mining village of South Hetton, close to where the dance film Billy Elliot was shot, with posters of Michael Owen and David Beckham on her wall. This week she met Beckham in person. Her mother Amanda, 47, a civil servant, told the Mail: ‘She sent me a text saying, “He’s perfect, Mum, he’s absolutely perfect”. ‘I told her that no man is perfect and she just said, “He is, Mum. He’s perfect”.’ Although she made Team GB – unlike Beckham – Miss Houghton can only dream of a lifestyle like his. Her £16,000 salary comes from England while she receives only expenses from her current club, Arsenal. Where it all began: Houghton's year began in fantastic fashion at the Olympics at Wembley . Celebration time: Steph takes in the Wembley atmosphere after she helped Team GB beat Brazil . Her shared home is close to the club’s training ground in London Colney, Hertfordshire. But if she is disappointed by her lifestyle, she doesn’t show it. She told the Mail: ‘It’s not comparable to the men’s game and it shouldn’t be: this is a completely different game.’ As a teenager, she watched Bend It Like Beckham ‘over and over again’, but her story also has more than a passing resemblance to 1981 film Gregory’s Girl, in which a teenage girl plays for a boys’ football team. Growing up: Aged eight, with four-year-old brother Stuart, and right, a star of the future at six months . She was given her first football at the age of three and, when she started primary school, became the only girl on the team. Her father Len, 47, an electrician, recalled how a boy’s parents were furious when their son was left out of the team in favour of her. He said: ‘They said she was the token girl and she shouldn’t have been picked at all. They said, “What’s she playing for, this is a boys’ game?” ‘Steph went on to score two goals in that match and someone said, “That’s why she was playing”.’ Number one fans: With grandmother Doreen and brother Stuart last year . At the age of nine, during a summer coaching camp run by Sunderland FC, she was spotted by a talent scout and joined the academy. She made her debut for the women’s team at 14 and moved on to Leeds United before signing for Arsenal in 2010. Her mother joked: ‘We tried to convert her into a girl but we couldn’t. She never had a doll or a pram. It was always just a football.’ Mr Houghton said: ‘The world is now her oyster. But she’s very level-headed and her feet are well and truly on the ground. ‘The Olympics will be over in a week for her and she’ll just head back to Arsenal and carry on as normal.’ Miss Houghton, who is single, said she had been inundated with messages from well-wishers. ‘The support I’ve had from family and friends has been unreal. My family always travel down and watch me play – and bring my grandma.’\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'The devastating tornado that killed 124 people in Missouri this week puts the United States on track for a record-breaking year -- despite improved forecasting, warning systems and public awareness, weather experts say. By 7:20 p.m. Tuesday, the death toll in Joplin had reached 124, making it the single deadliest tornado since the National Weather Service began keeping such records 61 years ago. The tornado in Joplin brought the number of people who have died in U.S. tornadoes to 489 so far this year. The figure could escalate as rescue workers continue digging through rubble from Sunday\\'s tornado in Joplin, Missouri. The deadliest tornado year on record is 1925, which had 794 deaths, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The number of fatalities so far this year is more than 8 1/2 times the average number for an entire year -- 56, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. With all the advancements in storm technology, the question is simple: Why? \"That\\'s the question of 2011,\" said Bob Henson of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. \"Why have so many people died in these tornadoes? That\\'s the open question. It\\'s partly because of the strength of these tornadoes. Also because they\\'ve hit populated areas.\" Myers said the brute force of some tornadoes might just be too severe for many structures. \"Some tornadoes, you just can\\'t survive them,\" he said. \"They\\'re just too big.\" Since 1875, the average number of deaths from tornadoes has actually decreased -- from about 200 to 55 a year, Myers said. This year is a sharp anomaly. In addition, the number of killer tornadoes is higher in 2011 -- 51 deadly tornadoes have touched down in the United States this year, compared to an average of 22 killer tornadoes in the past. That\\'s counting two more tornadoes in Missouri Tuesday night. And it\\'s only May. But early statistics on U.S. tornadoes have been spotty. Because twisters were not measured the same way they are now, experts don\\'t know whether the 1925 Tri-State tornado that killed about 695 people in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana was actually a single funnel or many -- which is why it\\'s not officially considered the deadliest single tornado. The weekend tornado in Joplin stirred memories of two fatal twisters that struck in Alabama last month. One tornado hit Hackleburg and Phil Campbell, killing 78 people, and another struck Tuscaloosa and Birmingham, killing 61. While many cities in tornado-prone areas have tornado sirens, the alarms sometimes get ignored. \"The sirens always go off, so no one thought anything of it,\" Joplin resident Alexa Wattelet said. \"Where we were, nobody really seemed like they were in much of a shock.\" But Myers said even if people take all possible precautions, a tornado can still leave fatalities. \"If you get hit by something the size of a 225 mph storm, it is not survivable,\" he said. \"And that is not to scare anyone. But the people that did it right are not to blame.\" CNN\\'s Sean Morris and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.',\n",

Though he receives an annual military pension of $40,000 a year, he told Philly.com he has been overwhelmed by debt since retiring from the Air Force and splitting up from his wife two years ago. The colonel explained that the bills mounted up - such as the cost of putting his two sons through college - and he couldn't return home, so he moved into his van. Freniere said he stays in motels when he can afford it, and also occasionally sleeps on friends' couches. Yet he has impressive experience behind him.

Freniere has also has had a full life outside of the military. Among other things, he has reportedly written screenplays, started businesses and enjoys leaning foreign languages - his nickname is Lightning. He told Philly.com that he has been diagnosed with dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. Yet he keeps applying for jobs all day and every day. 'How many applications can you fill out . in a day?

Fragments of a plate buried in Scotland 1,500 years ago have been used to illustrate the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by elite members of Roman society. Archaeologists were able to create this digital reconstruction of the ornate silver plate based upon two chunks of the original rim, which unearthed along with an enormous collection of Roman hacksilver in East Lothian in 1919. The 'highly decorative' silver fragments and the 70cm diameter of the reconstructed plate indicate that this was dinnerware 'fit for senators and the Roman elite', researchers said. Lavish: A digital reconstruction of the ornate Roman plate based on two original fragments unearthed near Haddington in East Lothian, Scotland, in 1919 . Fragment: This scrap of an original silver Roman plate discovered in Scotland was used to help create the digital reconstruction of the artefact in its original form . The pieces of the plate were part of the biggest collection of Roman hacksilver ever found, discovered at Traprain Law, a hill near Haddington, in 1919. A research team has used laser scanning to make what they believe is an accurate, full-size reconstruction of the dish, based on the curve and appearance of the surviving fragments. With a 70cm diameter, it is believed to be one of the largest known dishes from across the whole of the Roman Empire, and would have been a 'high status object', experts said. The reconstruction for National Museums Scotland was undertaken as part of the Glenmorangie Research Project, supporting the study and understanding of Early Medieval Scotland. High status object: The fragment, left, used as the basis for the digital reconstruction, right, was found among the Traprain Law hoard - the biggest collection of Roman hacksilver ever discovered . Alice Blackwell, Glenmorangie research officer at National Museums Scotland, said: 'The silver fragments are highly decorative and combined with what we now know about the plate’s size, this plate could only have been a high status object, fit for senators and the Roman elite. 'We are thrilled that the digital reconstruction has provided us with such a unique insight into the contents of this treasure hoard. 'Now, thanks to the support of Glenmorangie, we can build on our knowledge of Scotland’s early history, the murky transition from the Roman to Early Medieval periods and the enduring importance of silver in Scotland’s past.' Silver items in the Traprain Law hoard had been cut and folded into parcels, either to be exchanged or melted down and recycled into new objects. It is unlikely the contents of the haul were ever used in Scotland, as experts believe they were cut up before they arrived. The hoard is believed to have been buried in the middle of the 5th century AD, at a time when Roman silver was an important indicator of status and wealth. Hamish Torrie, a spokesman for the Glenmorangie Company, said: 'This is yet another exciting reveal from National Museums Scotland and follows on from other discoveries they have made during the course of our partnership. 'It’s great to see modern technology being used to re-evaluate the world famous Traprain hoard. We are proud to be associated with this exciting research into early Scotland.'\",\n",

Vince Cable faced fresh calls to resign today after it emerged Royal Mail could have been worth £10billion – three times what the government sold for it. The CWU union claimed that in any other walk of life, securing such a poor deal 'would be a sacking offence' for the Business Secretary. It follows reports banking giant JP Morgan told the government that it would value the firm, including its debts, at £7.75billion to £9.95bilion. Grilling: Business Secretary Vince Cable is to face questions from MPs next month on whether Royal Mail was sold off on the cheap . The revelation reignited the furious row . about whether ministers rushed to sell off the national postal service . on the cheap, handing big profits to City investors. Shares in Royal Mail were sold by the government at £3.30 earlier this month, which valued the firm at £3.3billion. But since then shares have soared to over £5, suggesting the company is worth £5billion. Mr Cable last week claimed threats of strike action forced . ministers to cut the value of Royal Mail on the eve of its sell-off. But CWU general secretary Billy Hayes said today: 'On the opening day of the flotation Vince Cable wrote off the undervaluation as froth. A week later, we were told it was the fault of the CWU. 'We now have a prima facie case of a conspiracy against the UK taxpayer who were opposed to the sale and have now been robbed of billions. 'In any other walk of life this would be a sacking offence and we call on Vince Cable to resign.' Ministers were again challenged about the valuation in the Commons today. Business minister Michael Fallon insisted that ‘price volatility’ was to be expected in the immediate aftermath of a sale. He said: ‘But let's be very clear this sale was popular, it was over-subscribed and it was successful.’ However, Labour seized the claim that the firm could be worth even more. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: ‘The news that yet another leading investment bank valued Royal Mail at a far higher price than that for which it was sold will only add to fears that taxpayers have been significantly short changed by David Cameron’s Royal Mail fire sale. ‘This latest valuation is up to three times above what the public stake in the business was sold at.’ It comes as the Whitehall spending watchdog announced it would carry out a value for money probe into the sale, to ensure the taxpayer was not ripped off. The National Audit Office said: ‘The examination will cover the issues of how the price range for the initial public offering was set and the discussion of possible revisions to the range.’ Value: The government sold Royal Mail, valued at £3.3billion, earlier this month but now it has emerged that JP Morgan valued it at almost £10billion . The news follows the revelation that activist hedge fund the Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI) has amassed a 5.8 per cent stake in Royal Mail. It has bought 58.2 million shares worth around £290 million. A Department of Business spokeman said: ‘A total of 21 banks pitched in May for the business of acting for the Government on the sale of Royal Mail as part of an extensive procurement process. Seven were successful. ‘The proposals included indicative valuations of the company based, in many instances, solely on information already in the public domain.\\xa0 Banks made their own assumptions of Royal Mail’s future performance. The range was wide with the median around £3.6bn taking into account [an] IPO [initial public offering] discount. ‘The banks' appointment process was overseen by Lazard as independent advisors to Government. ‘The banks' proposals came months before any threat of strike action by the unions, financial market uncertainty in the United States and other factors which the Government has already said were taken into consideration in setting a price for the company in September.’\",\n",

Killer Ian Brady believes celebrities like Noel Edmonds and Chris Evans should be 'culled' and calls for the working class to riot against the middle class in a series of demented rants. In letters sent from his room in a high-security psychiatric hospital, the Moors Murderer also calls The Beatles 'puerile' and hints darkly about his horrendous crimes. Brady, 76, was jailed for life in 1966 along with his girlfriend Myra Hindley for abducting, abusing, torturing and killing five youngsters in Manchester before burying them on nearby Saddleworth Moor. He has been held at Ashworth high-security psychiatric hospital in Liverpool since 1985. Hindley died in 2002. The letters, seen by the Sunday Mirror, were in the possession of Micky Lloyd, 35, a campaigner working to find the body of Keith Bennett, the only one of his five young victims whose remains have never been found. Bizarrely, Brady says the public should be able to vote for the celebrities they want to see killed. The letter reads: 'The likes of Noel Edmonds and Chris Evans come crawling back from nowhere, not content to enjoy the pile they've made but craving more fame.' Another passage singles out The Beatles, who were at the height of their fame when he was committing his crimes, stating: '(The Beatles) with their little uniforms and haircuts... were puerile.'

              "  {'content': 'Judges at the International Criminal Court ruled Wednesday that Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir may be charged with genocide for his role in a five-year campaign of violence in western Sudan\\'s Darfur region. Al-Bashir, who remains in office, has already been charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo had the genocide charge on his original arrest warrant for al-Bashir, but the pre-trial judges left off the charge when they approved the warrant last March. Moreno-Ocampo appealed in July, saying that the judges\\' standard for adding the genocide charge was too high. The appellate court agreed with Moreno-Ocampo and ruled in his favor Wednesday. The appeals judges said the pre-trial chamber had applied an \"erroneous standard of proof\" to the genocide charge. The judges said they were not ruling on whether al-Bashir should be charged with genocide -- only whether the charge could be added to the arrest warrant. They said it will be up to the pre-trial chamber to determine whether to add the charge to the warrant, which could take several weeks. The International Criminal Court at The Hague, Netherlands, is a permanent, treaty-based tribunal dealing with the most serious crimes against humanity. It is an independent court that is not part of the United Nations. It is funded primarily by nations, but also receives contributions from governments, corporations and individuals. Even if genocide is added to the arrest warrant, Moreno-Ocampo still faces a challenge in proving the charges at trial, said Mark Ellis, the executive director of the International Bar Association. \"Genocide is a much more complicated legal position to meet (than war crimes and crimes against humanity), because you have to show in proving genocide that there was a specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group based on -- in this case -- ethnicity or race,\" Ellis told CNN in July. \"Obviously, the prosecutor believes he would be able to prove this intent and so he wants the opportunity to prove that in trial.\" The warrant for al-Bashir was the first ever issued by the ICC for a sitting head of state. It currently includes five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape. It also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging. Al-Bashir has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued, even though any country that is party to the ICC has an obligation to hand him over to The Hague, the court says. He openly attended the African Union conference in Ethiopia, which ended this week. Ethiopia is not party to the ICC. Al-Bashir is the front-runner in an election scheduled to take place in April, and a genocide charge is unlikely to harm his prospects. A genocide charge could further isolate Sudan, but it could also mobilize African nations around Sudan. Leaders from several African countries have said the ICC has been unfair to Africa, and they have threatened to pull out of the court. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes. Sudan denies that the death toll is that high. The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. CNN\\'s David McKenzie contributed to this report.',\n",

The adult daughter of a woman whose baby was fatally shot in his stroller testified Wednesday that her mother\\'s account of what happened that day didn\\'t add up. A defense lawyer called Ashley Glassey to testify in the murder trial of his client, De\\'Marquise Elkins, who is charged in the March 21 killing of 13-month-old Antonio Santiago in coastal Georgia. Glassey\\'s mother, Sherry West, has said she was walking home from the Brunswick post office with Antonio in a stroller when Elkins, 18, and another teen approached her and demanded money. After she told them she didn\\'t have any, Elkins shot her in the leg and then shot the baby in the face, West has said. Scroll down for video . Suspicious: Ashley Glassey doesn\\'t beleive mother Sharon West about the circumstances surrounding her baby brother\\'s death . Glassey, 21, lives in New Jersey and testified through tears that she had only seen her mother for a few hours on one occasion since she was 8 years old. Glassey said her mother called her at 8:30 p.m. the day of the shooting. West told her daughter two kids had come up to her and asked for money and then shot the baby and then her when she said she had none, Glassey said. When Glassey asked for more details, West changed the story to say she was shot first and the baby second, Glassey said. Glassey\\'s grandmother had died the summer before and she had collected her grandmother\\'s life insurance policy to cover expenses, Glassey said. Her mother knew that and called to ask how fast Glassey thought it would take for her to get the payment from a life insurance policy she had taken out on the baby. \"The whole conversation just didn\\'t settle well with me,\" Glassey said. A life ended too soon: 13-month-old Antonio Santago (left) was shot to death by De\\'Marquise Elkins, according to Sharon West (right) Questionable: West is alleged to have asked estranged daughter Glassey about how to collect a life insurance policy on her dead toddler only hours after the shooting . Because she thought her mother\\'s story didn\\'t add up, she called law enforcement in Brunswick to tell them that and said she needed to talk to detectives in the case, she said. But when the police didn\\'t call her, she told some media outlets how her mother had asked about the life insurance payout. After Glassey\\'s statements appeared, an angry West called her and told her she had no business talking to the news and that\\'s the last time the two spoke, Glassey said. West testified Tuesday that she had taken out a life insurance policy on her young son because he had been sick just after he was born and someone at the hospital mentioned the idea to her. She took out a $5,000 policy from Gerber Life Insurance Co., she said. West paid a premium of $3.18 each month, and when her son was killed, she cashed in the policy, she said. She used $2,000 for funeral costs for Antonio and used the balance to pay her moving expenses, she said. In tears: Glassey chokes back tears as she testifies to her suspicions surrounding her baby brother\\'s death . Accused: De\\'Marquise Elkins, 18, is accused of shooting both Santiago and West despite West picking the wrong person in a police lineup . Prosecutors say Elkins and an accomplice, 15-year-old Dominique Lang, stopped West, and the older teen pointed a small .22-caliber revolver at her and demanded money before shots were fired. The killing in the port city of Brunswick drew national attention, and the trial was moved to the Atlanta suburb of Marietta owing to extensive publicity . Elkins faces life in prison if convicted of murder. At the time of the shooting he was 17, too young to face the death penalty if convicted under Georgia law. Lang, who also faces murder charges, is to be tried at a later date. Prosecutors have said information from Elkins\\' mother and sister led investigators to a pond where they found a revolver. Karimah Elkins is standing trial alongside her son on charges of evidence tampering and lying to police. Elkins\\' sister also was charged with evidence tampering.

Scroll down for video . Seriously stylish: Jerry Hall wearing Jap & Joseph in 'Jamaica Blue', a shoot published by Vogue in May 1975 . Champion: Coco Chanel in striped knitted jersey photographed in 1929 by Alex Stewart Sasha . Accompanying the clothes will be a series of photos taken by greats such as Horst P. Horst which show off the knits in all their glamorous vintage glory. ‘Decade by decade, this incredible . collection charts over 100 years of knitwear history,' says Celia . Joicey, head of the Fashion and Textile Museum. 'It . is the first exhibition of its kind to explore not only key designers . but also technical innovations in hand, machine and industrial knitting.' But as the exhibition makes clear, knitwear wasn't always so glamorous with knitting and crocheting long associated with functional fashion and undergarments. That all changed when World War One broke out and wool, one of the first textiles to become scarce thanks to its use in army uniforms, became a luxury. By the 1920s, the flexible nature of wool and increasing demand for sportier pieces resulted in knitwear becoming truly fashionable for the first time, helped along by Coco Chanel. Key to the knit's new look was Chanel's championing of jersey, a wool-based machine woven textile, which was traditionally used to make men's pants. Chanel, however, had other ideas and reworked the material into easy-wearing twinsets and chic frocks - an innovation considered incredibly daring in the heady days of the 1920s. Later, the material was used to make evening dresses, as was crochet, all enlivened by metallic yarns, deco colouring and exotic details. By the time the Second World War arrived, the jumper was a firm fixture in the fashion firmament but clothing restrictions meant that once more, women had to invent creative ways to wear it. Many were unravelled and recycled when . they became too tatty to bear, with multicoloured jumpers becoming a . staple thanks to the reuse of wool taken from other garments. Renaissance: A 1920s knitted coat (left) and an elegant grey ensemble photographed by Horst P. Horst in 1947 . Cheerful: Multi-coloured designs such as these 1930s jumpers became popular during the war years . That, however, was the final time that the jumper played a purely practical part in women's wardrobes and almost as soon as VE day arrived, the knit began a trajectory that took it into the heart of the fashion world. The late 40s and early 50s saw the 'cocktail sweater' reign supreme in wardrobes around the world, thanks in no small part to the influence of Hollywood stars who wore theirs nipped in at the waist and embellished with embroidery and beading. Later, the crocheted cocktail dress became popular, with hems shortening exponentially as the 1960s approached and throughout the decade. With Chanel gone, Rudi Gernreich and André Courrèges led the charge to champion knitwear, embracing wool and jersey fabrics in their . futuristic designs. And it wasn't just designers who embraced the trend. Easier to make than the cocktail knit, short dresses became a favourite of young women all over the UK, who knitted their own using patterns published in magazines such as Vogue and Tatler.

Beautiful: A silk jersey duster coat circa 1919 (left) and a Jean Muir creation dating from the 1970s (right) The . novelty knit first seen during the war years reappeared in the 70s, this time featuring bright colours and kitsch . motifs, popularised by Fiorucci and Kenzo. The 1970s were also a . fertile era of fashion design, Ossie Clark, Biba, Rae Spencer Cullen for . Miss Mouse, Bill Gibb and Mary Quant all championing knitwear. But it wasn't until the 1980s that knitwear in its current incarnation really took off, with Vivienne Westwood, Rei Kawakubo for Comme . des Garçons, Zandra Rhodes and Sonia Rykiel all creating sophisticated collections based on the formerly humble jumper. By the time the 1990s and the noughties rolled around, knitwear was an established part of fashion although it hasn't completely lost its ability to astound. From Julien MacDonald to Mark Fast and Stella McCartney, the jumper continues to inspire fashion's hottest names - and those who buy them. 'Knitwear in fashion is often taken for granted,' comments Joicey, 'but this exhibition is an opportunity to celebrate knitwear centre stage and to inspire future design directions.' Curator Dennis Nothdruft added: ‘Knitwear is imbued with narrative and memory. This exhibition is a way of accessing other people’s stories.' Knitwear Chanel to Westwood opens on the 19th September at the Fashion and Textiles Museum in London. See ftmlondon.org for more information.\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'Iran\\'s controversial president defended his government\\'s relationship with the country\\'s supreme leader on Friday, disputing charges of a political rift. Iranian government said Ahmadinejad won two-thirds of the vote in the June 12 vote. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, speaking to a gathering in Mashad in northern Iran, rejected claims by people who have attempted to cast the relationship between his government and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \"as tainted,\" according to Iran\\'s Islamic Republic News Agency. \"They are ignorant of the fact that our relationship with the respected leader is far above the framework of politics and administration and is based on love and faith, and resembles the relationship between father and son,\" Ahmadinejad said. \"The efforts of ill wishers to insinuate such doubts is fruitless, and they will surely take such wishes to their graves. This road is blocked to the devils.\" Differences between high-ranking Iranian officials over the controversial June presidential elections have stoked talk of a rift in the government and the Shiite religious hierarchy that rules the country. In addition, Ahmadinejad has been criticized lately by conservatives and opposition politicians for appointing a controversial politician, Esfandyar Rahim Mashaie, to the post of first vice president. Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered Ahmadinejad to nullify Mashaie\\'s appointment, and Mashaie announced he would resign from the position. Ahmadinejad then appointed Mashaie presidential adviser and head of his bureau. Mashaie made enemies among Iran\\'s fundamentalists when he reportedly said last year that the Iranian people are friends with all people, including Israelis. He was also criticized for attending a ceremony in Turkey where women danced on stage. In Iran, women are forbidden to dance in public and Iranian officials are expected to leave when such entertainment is provided for them while they are visiting abroad. Mashaie\\'s daughter is married to Ahmadinejad\\'s son. He is among the president\\'s closest confidants and Ahmadinejad has defended Mashaie despite the criticism. The latest criticism of Ahmadinejad came during Friday prayers. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, the head of Iran\\'s Guardian Council, criticized the move to make Mashaie a vice president and Ahmadinejad\\'s firing of Cabinet members. Ahmadinejad is scheduled to be officially approved on Monday by the supreme leader and inaugurated Wednesday before the nation\\'s parliament. Many Iranians believe Ahmadinejad\\'s victory in the June elections was rigged, and the result prompted angry protests. People took to the streets Thursday to mourn the death during street demonstrations last month of Neda Agha-Soltan, who has emerged as a symbol of the post-election ferment. Agha-Soltan, 26, was shot during protests on June 20. Her last moments were captured on a shaky video, probably shot with a cell phone, that was seen around the world. More than 3,000 people came to a Tehran cemetery to mourn on the 40th day after her death -- a custom in Shiite Islam. Clashes broke out there and at other locations between police and demonstrators or mourners. One clash occurred at the Grand Mosalla -- a mosque under construction in Tehran. Press TV said that at least 50 Iranians were arrested when thousands of people gathered in Tehran, but most were released a short time later, a senior police official said. Mir Hossein Moussavi, the main opposition leader during the election, attempted to go to the gravesite but was turned away by security forces. On Friday, a Moussavi video surfaced on a Facebook site. In it, he defended the opposition movement and stressed the message that Iranians must return to the principles and ideals of the Islamic revolution in 1979. And he also made similar points in remarks published by the Iranian Labour News Agency on July 27.',\n",

A Massachusetts teenager accused of killing his math teacher with a box cutter appeared to be 'psychotic' after he allegedly attacked a youth female clinician in Boston earlier this month. According to the petition to have Philip Chism committed to Worcester Recovery Center and Hospital for 30 days of evaluation and treatment, the 15-year-old was 'out of touch with reality' and 'yelling, screaming incoherently [and] foaming at the mouth while being restrained by staff.' The attack happened June 2 at a Department of Youth Services detention center. Scroll down for video . Danger to others: Prosecutors have requested tighter security for Philip Chism, 15 (pictured in January), after he allegedly escaped carers and tried to choke a youth worker . The details were released Tuesday by a Superior Court judge in response to a motion by The Salem News. Chism . pleaded not guilty to robbing, raping and killing 24-year-old Danvers . High School teacher Colleen Ritzer after following her into a restroom . last October. He was 14 at the time. Essex County prosecutors said 15-year-old Philip Chism slipped away from caregivers before the June 2 incident. Prosecutor . Kate MacDougall said Chism crept along a common hallway 'crouched down . out of view,' followed the woman to a locker room and tried to choke her . while holding a pencil. Other workers came to the woman's aid when she . screamed. In the petition to have Chism committed, psychologist Kenneth Rogers wrote that the teenager strangled, punched and stabbed the female unit clinician. 'Once pulled off her, he was out of touch with reality, screaming, yelling and moaning incoherently for about two hours even as he was taken away,' wrote Rogers. The document also stated that Chism's mother informed officials that before the June 2 attack her son had no history of psychosis. Alleged assault: Chism attacked a youth worker at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Boston, say prosecutors . During a hearing held June 10, the . prosecutor insisted that Chism not be left alone with female staff at . the facility, describing the teen as 'someone who appeared utterly calm . and fine in the moments leading up to the event.' Kate . MacDougall also expressed concern that within the detention center, . patients are free to move around, which could potentially put female . staff and patients at risk . Lester Blumberg, the Department of Mental Health attorney who represented the hospital at the hearing, assured the prosecutor that while the patients' rooms are not locked, Chism remains under guard at night and is rarely alone. Missed: Math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, was raped and murdered with a box cutter last October . Authorities . still don't know what motivated the transfer student . from Clarksville, Tenneessee to kill his teacher. He has pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder in the death of Ritzer, whose body was found in the woods near Danvers High School in October. Her throat was slit and a note reading, 'I hate you all' was found at the scene. Chism, . who had been asked to stay late by Ritzer to help after school, . allegedly followed her into a bathroom on October 22 and attacked her, . sexually assaulted her twice, including once with a stick, stripped her and then stole her cellphone, . credit cars and her driver's licenses. According . to investigators, her body was then placed in a recycling bin and . carted away to a wooded area behind the school and dumped. After . dumping her body, prosecutors say Chism returned to school barefoot . where he changed into his soccer clothes and threw away his bloodied . school clothes. He then went to eat a burger at Wendy's and caught a screening of Woody Allen film 'Blue Jasmine'. Police . arrested him later that evening when he was found walking down a busy . highway. He had a bloody box-cutter in his pocket along with Ritzer's . underwear. Last . month, Ritzer's parents, Tom and Peggie Ritzer, issued a video statement . speaking about their loss while also thanking the community for their . support. 'These . past six months have been a period of great pain and sorrow for our . family and all those who knew and loved Colleen,' mother Peggie said. 'Each . day presents new challenges but we are blessed by the support of family . and friends. Through the many acts of genuine kindness to honor our . daughter and sister, our spirits are lifted. Though difficult, we strive . to follow Colleen's words to find good in every day.' Mental health: Chism's mental state is being evaluated at the Worcester State Hospital . Crime scene: Colleen Ritzer's body was found in a wooded area near Danvers High School following the brutal killing . Heartbroken: In a video shared last month, . Ritzer's family spoke about their loss while thanking the community for . support. Pictured is Ritzer's sister Laura, father Tom, mother Peggie and brother Tom . In the video, Mr Ritzer thanked everyone for turning out to raise money in Colleen's name. 'Thank . you for your kind words, generous gestures and support of the . scholarship fund in Colleen’s name that will empower future generations . of thoughtful, caring teachers to emulate Colleen’s passion to inspire . students to discover their full potential,' Mr Rtizer said, flanked by . Mrs Ritzer and Colleen's sister Laura and brother Tom. Following . his arrest, classmates and teachers at the school expressed shock that . such a quiet and polite boy could commit such a horrendous crime.

There was no word on the fate of the refinery, which lies on Beiji's northern outskirts, today but the advances in the town could help break the five-month siege of the facility by Islamic State fighters. Iraqi soldiers battling ISIS have recaptured most of the town of Beiji, home to the country's largest oil refinery which has been under attack by militants for more than five months. Pictured: Smoke rises from the facility . Since June, a small army unit inside the refinery has successfully resisted wave after wave of extremist assaults. Lifting the siege of the refinery, which sits inside a sprawling complex, was said to be the next objective in the campaign to rid Beiji of the militants, according to military officials  in the town. However, hours after news of the recapturing of Beiji broke, a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden car into a military outpost in the Tarmiyah district north of Baghdad, killing seven soldiers and wounding 13 others. Those killed included the post's commander, a major, two other officers, a captain and a lieutenant, police said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but it bore the hallmarks of the militant Sunnis of the Islamic State group. Elsewhere, nine people were killed and 24 injured in three separate blasts in and around Baghdad. State television has today quoted the top army commander in Beiji, Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, as saying troops also recaptured Beiji's local government and police headquarters at the centre of the town. It aired footage of army tanks and armored personnel carriers moving around the town's dusty streets and a ball of white smoke rising in the background. Al-Saadi later spoke to state television by telephone but the line appeared to be cut off after he said his forces were meeting stiff resistance. Three military officials later said the advancing army troops and Shiite militiamen are being slowed down by booby-trapped houses and ambushes. Iraqi military forces (pictured in Jurf al-Sakher town, south of Baghdad earlier this week) have reclaimed Beiji . Raed Ibrahim, the governor of Salahuddin province, where both Beiji and Tikrit are located, said the military had secured about 75 per cent of the town, retaking the centre of the town and outlying districts. He said government forces continued to meet fierce resistance from the militants, whom he said were using suicide bombers to stall the military's advance. Neither the military officials nor Ibrahim gave casualty figures for the government forces or the militants. The officials, however, said the forces had blocked access to Beiji from Anbar province, where militants control vast swaths of land, prior to their assault on the town to prevent militant reinforcements from reaching the city. Government officials in Baghdad offered no immediate comment on the news. The Beiji oil refinery has a capacity of some 320,000 barrels a day, accounting for a quarter of Iraq's refining capacity. A fire raged for days back in June at one of its storage units, but the refinery is believed to have also suffered major damage elsewhere. Iraq's army and security forces have partially regrouped after melting away in the face of the summer's Islamic State group offensive. ISIS militants retreated from the town of Jurf al-Sakher in the wake of Iraqi military forces fighting back . In recent weeks, they have recaptured a string of small towns and villages, but taking Beiji would be strategically significant in what is shaping up to be a drawn-out campaign of attrition against the extremists. Recapturing Beiji also would be a major boost for Iraq's Shiite-led government. Airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition have aided Iraqi forces, militias and Kurdish peshmerga fighters battling Islamic State militants. Hundreds of U.S. advisers and trainers also have been working with the Iraqis. U.S. Central Command said yesterday that coalition aircraft have conducted seven airstrikes near Beiji since Friday, destroying three small militant units, a sniper position and two militant vehicles, including one used for construction.\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'If Mars has any exhibitionist tendencies, this should be a good month -- one packed with star power -- for the red planet. On Tuesday night, Mars, Earth and the sun were positioned along a nearly straight line, called the date of opposition because Mars and the sun are on opposite sides of the sky, according to NASA. If the orbits of Mars and Earth were perfectly circular, April 8 would also have been when the two planets were nearest each other. But because they\\'re slightly egg-shaped, the date of closest approach does not occur until Monday. That night, the two planets will be a mere 57 million miles (92 million kilometers) apart. Also on tap for the celestial show is a total lunar eclipse, when the moon will turn as red as Mars itself. \"Mars rises in the east at sunset and soars almost overhead at midnight, shining burnt-orange almost 10 times brighter than a 1st-magnitude star,\" NASA says. But no need to set your alarms or to buy a telescope: Mars, in all its glory, is easy to see on any clear night in April with the naked eye. If you miss this event, you can witness the next \"opposition of Mars\" in 26 months. A recent view of the planet taken from space has proved far different, but no less tantalizing. Was it a Martian playing flashlight tag with the Curiosity rover? The faraway glare from an extraterrestrial\\'s TV? Or maybe someone warming up over a fire on the Red Planet\\'s surface? Probably not. Still, the latest snapshot from the Curiosity is pretty cool. It shows the stark Martian landscape with a light shining in front of a mountain chain. While enjoying the shot, the Curiosity Rover\\'s official Twitter feed says it\\'s more illusion than evidence of life: \"Ooh. Shiny. Bright spot in this pic is likely a glinting rock or cosmic-ray hit.\" A few pictures -- shot April 2 and 3 through the rover\\'s \"right-eye\" camera -- show the bright spots, while those shot within a second through the \"left-eye\" camera don\\'t, said Guy Webster, a spokesman with NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Hence, it\\'s unlikely any being -- from whatever world -- caused them. Each time, \"the sun was in the same direction as the bright spot -- west-northwest from the rover -- and relatively low in the sky,\" said Webster, who said one could surmise that the sun was reflecting off the rock the same way in each shot. Or perhaps, he added, the spots could be a function of light affecting the camera itself. Either way, the pictures add to the vast photo album that Curiosity has created since setting off from Earth in November 2011 and landing -- some 8-1/2 months later and 99 million miles away -- on Mars. The 1-ton, SUV-sized vehicle is carrying 17 cameras and a number of scientific instruments, making it far from your average shutterbug.

Brooks wrote to Coulson: \\'I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you.\\' The full letter exposing the affair between Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson was given to the phone hacking jury for the first time today. In the letter, Brooks, 45, told Coulson \\'I love you\\' as she pours her heart out over the end of their six-year relationship, it is said. Jurors at the Old Bailey were today handed the two-and-a-half page document - but were required to read in silence the first part of the letter, which will not now be heard in open court. Brooks, seated next to husband Charlie, and Coulson, 46, both stared ahead intently as the document, in which Brooks writes: \\'You are my very best friend\\', was read. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC then repeated the extract he had already read when he addressed the jury at the start of the trial, in early November. Brooks writes: \\'You are my very best friend. I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you.\\' It is claimed the pair, who are on trial for phone hacking together, dated in secret between 1998 and 2004. Mr Edis repeated those passages again in open court today after revealing that the document had been recovered from one of Brooks\\' computers. Writing to Coulson, she says: \\'Finally and the least of our worries, but how do we really work this new relationship? \\'There are a hundred things that have happened since Saturday night that I would normally share with you, some important, most trivial. \\'The fact is you are my very best . friend. I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I . love you, care about you, worry about you. \\'We laugh and cry together. In fact without our relationship in my life, I am really not sure how I will cope. Brooks, seated next to husband Charlie, stared ahead intently as the document, in which she wrote: \\'You are my very best friend\\', was read . \\'I\\'m frightened to be without you, but bearing in mind \"the rules\" you will not know how I am doing and vice versa. \\'The thought of finding out anything about you or your life from someone else fills me with absolute dread. \\'Also you said I had to email you if anything important happened, like if I was ill? \\'I don\\'t understand this, we are either there for each other or not surely? \\'Anyway, that really isn\\'t where I am confused. I know what horror it means and I know why we have to stick to it. \\'But for example, how does this work thing manifest itself. Rebekah Brooks\\' phone was hacked 43 times by News of the World investigator Glenn Mulcaire in 2006, the court heard. The convicted phone hacker was also listening to Andy Coulson\\'s voicemails at the same time, even hacking him six times on a single day. Brooks\\' maiden name, Rebekah Wade, appeared several times in Mulcaire\\'s notes recovered by police. On one page, he had an account number alongside her name, a list of mobile phone service providers, and the word \\'Vodafone\\'. Another page with Brooks\\' name had her mobile number and the names of ex-husband Ross Kemp and former News International lawyer Tom Crone. Mulcaire had made notes on Coulson but misspelt his name as \\'Coulsdon\\', the court heard. Phone records show that Brooks was hacked 13 times in March 2006, 15 times in April, another ten times in May, and five times in June and July. Coulson was targeted six times on February 1, 2006, and another five times later in the month. His voicemails were hacked another eight times in June and July 2006, the court heard. Mr Edis showed this data in agreed admission presented to the jury at the close of the prosecution case. \\'Do we limit contact until we absolutely have to, like leaving our execs to sort run-of-the-mill joint stuff? I don\\'t want to get this wrong. \\'I hope that I\\'ve managed to put your mind at rest about Les, and that you two now have a better relationship. \\'On KRM [Rupert Murdoch], well he\\'s not b*llocking you must not brood on lack of calls. \\'Obviously I can\\'t discuss my worries, concerns, problems at work with you anymore, and vice versa, but I\\'ll assume unless I hear different that we keep our professional relationship to the minimum, and avoid if possible without it being in any way awkward. \\'If it is necessary or more importantly right that we two editors should deal with it, then we will. If either of us feels that we are not striking this balance then we must say.\\' The letter was presented to the jury as the prosecution case draws to a close. This is the third time in the trial the unusual step of asking jurors to read evidence in silence has been taken. It was first used over privacy concerns with voicemails left by former Home Secretary David Blunkett, and again for two email exchanges involving journalists at The Sun. The court also heard how Brooks emailed ex-husband Ross Kemp saying they needed to ‘talk about phone hacking’ three weeks before her arrest. The email to the former Eastenders actor was recovered from Brooks’ BlackBerry mobile phone, having been sent at 11.03pm on June 23, 2011. ‘Hello, how are you?’, she wrote. ‘Need to talk to you about phone hacking at some point. When are you free?’ Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC then told jurors that less than half an hour later, Brooks emailed her personal assistants Deborah Keegan and Cheryl Carter saying: ‘Need my 2002/03 diaries.’ The emails were taken off the BlackBerry seized from Brooks when she was first arrested on July 17, 2011. Another email is to Carter on July 8, 2011, saying: ‘Coffee and hot milk please, separately. This is disgusting.’ Jurors at the Old Bailey were today handed the two-and-a-half page document from Brooks to Coulson - but were forced to in silence the first part of the letter, which will not now be heard in open court . Mr Edis said: ‘This is the day of the withdrawal of the notebooks from the archive’, referring to the charge that Brooks and Carter face together. The jury heard many of Brooks’ emails have been lost forever because she did not agree for them to be kept in an archive. The former News International chief executive decided not to ‘opt in’ to an automatic archive system when it was installed in 2005. As a result, very few of her emails over six years at News International including four years as editor of The Sun have been recovered by police. Prosecutor Mark Bryant-Heron told the court: ‘Mrs Brooks never opted in to using News International’s original archive system when it was installed in January 2005. ‘This meant emails on Mrs Brooks’ email account were not retained on the archiving system. ‘Emails sent to her and received from her by other employees would be retained on the system in those users’ own archiving system, unless deleted by that user within 14 days.’ He added the ‘percentage of her account recovered cannot be confirmed.’ The court heard police investigating phone hacking at the News of the World and corruption at The Sun have recovered four batches of emails from the News International system. One was the ‘live email archive’ from 2000 to 2007, there are two systems that have been rebuilt, and a back-up system. The court heard that nearly 4.5m emails from 2005 to 2010 were purged by News International as part of a routine clean-out in September 2010, but 1.49m had subsequently been recovered from other sources. Jurors also heard that Brooks’ old hard drive from her office in Wapping was removed prior to the computer being disposed of. The removal happened after the News International executive moved to new offices in Thomas More Square in January 2011, and were issued with new computers. However, on an audit in May 2011, it was discovered there was no hard drive in Brooks’ now redundant computer. The computer was then thrown away because Brooks’ name was not on a list of phone hacking suspects whose computer equipment was being preserved. After today, the trial will take a break for several days of legal discussions before resuming on Monday, February 17 when the defence cases are due to begin. Rebekah Brooks, of Chipping Norton, Coulson, of Charing, Kent, and Kuttner, of Woodford Green, Essex all deny of one count of conspiracy to intercept communications. Brooks also denies two counts of perverting the course of justice and two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. Coulson, with Clive Goodman, of Woodham, Addlestone, Surrey, also denies two counts of misconduct in a public office. Carter, of Chelmsford, Essex, Hanna, of Buckingham, Bucks, and Charles Brooks, of Chipping Norton all deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The trial has now been adjourned for legal argument until Monday, February 17. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.',\n",

The 50-plus Oscar winner, producer and political activist George Clooney is apparently engaged to be married. He\\'s at a particularly pivotal age. Forget about the 50s being the new 40s -- the 50s are really very specific. Even the most youthful people will start thinking about the meaning of life as the years no longer stretch out in a fantasy of infinity. Those years between 50 and 60 do seem to be a particularly poignant age for men, especially the kind of man who has trouble giving up motorcycles. Sometime in this period, the thrill seekers and lust lovers get their whiff of mortality (perhaps because of their latest motorcycle accident) and they turn to love with a new sense of its gravitas. With a nod to the motivation most of us mortals have, they are ready for an emotional legacy. (Hint: watch for children) It might irk Clooney to be seen as so predictable. He\\'s a gifted, idiosyncratic, goes-his-own-way, irreverent kind of guy. But he has been practicing for this life transition in full view. In his films, he has played lost middle-aged men, lost in their careers, lost in neglected marriages, lost because of a lack of connection to something important -- \"Up in the Air,\" \"The Descendents,\" \"Michael Clayton,\" among others. Many of these men reshuffle their lives, readjust their principles or at least find some self knowledge they sorely lacked. What we know about Amal Alamuddin . If the reports of his engagement are true, this is kind of what Clooney has done, and what a lot of professionally single men ultimately come to do, especially about love. His apparent fiancee, Amal Alamuddin, is an accomplished and wordly lawyer. Clooney\\'s doing that middle-aged love choice. He\\'s picking a woman of substance as well as beauty -- the kind of woman you would want as friend and counselor, the kind of woman who would have the genes to be the mother of your children -- and it\\'s now, because it suddenly dawns on you that you have no time to lose. In this scenario of the chastened older Lothario, the candidate is young enough to lust after and smart enough for impregnation. It\\'s not that women, especially stars, don\\'t come to the same point as Clooney and end up in the same position. But biology forces them to make the comparable choice at least a decade or so earlier. Unlike a woman his age, Clooney can do the whole settling-down gambit at almost any age. But he probably understood some ages are better for this than others. I know this isn\\'t very romantic, but the timing is -- whether the 50-something group knows it or not -- guided by the Grim Reaper. If that sounds bad, it\\'s not. Middle age is an important time for reassessment and course correction. No matter how bright your star, you know that only so much time is left to have a profound relationship and, perhaps, a family. This is the real anchor of middle-aged love: It\\'s time to stop fooling around.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'By . Jaya Narain . A boy of ten raped a classmate in the toilets of his primary school as he ‘acted out’ scenes from online pornography, a court was told. The jury heard that he approached a fellow pupil during an English lesson and asked if he wanted to have sex with him. Thinking he was joking, the other boy replied: ‘No way.’ But after the lesson the alleged victim went to the toilets and, as he went to leave, the defendant was said to have walked in and grabbed him. Allegations: A 10-year-old boy has been accused of raping a classmate, also aged 10, in the toilets of a school in Colwyn Bay. The boy has pleaded not guilty to two charges. The trial is being held at Mold Crown Court . The court heard the boy then pushed him over a sink and raped him. The victim, also 10, told him to stop and after about 10 seconds the alleged attacker pulled away, and apparently said: ‘Oh come on, the party’s just starting.’ Yesterday Mold Crown Court in North Wales was told the schoolboy had carried out the rape after watching pornography online. Karl Scholz, prosecuting, said: ‘It is almost certain that in this case what was being done was to act out what had been seen in pornographic material.’ He said the jury may conclude that what lay behind the alleged incident was the availability of pornography on the internet. ‘It is that which may lie behind the corruption of the minds of the people involved in this case,’ said Mr Scholz. The accused boy, who is now 12, faces a charge of rape and a second charge of inciting his classmate to engage in sexual activity. The alleged rape happened at a primary school in Colwyn Bay. The boy was so embarrassed that he might be branded homosexual he did not tell anyone until he was interviewed by teachers over a separate incident. The boy also claimed that on another occasion the defendant and another boy pretended to be gay in the toilets, kissing each other. Each was said to have exposed himself and the complainant was told to carry out a sex act on the one he preferred. He alleged that he was grabbed by the second boy and his head was pushed down before he broke free and ran off. The other boy was not before the court. Campaign: The Mail is pressing for tighter controls on internet porn, which is viewed by many under-18s . Mr Scholz claimed that in a further incident the defendant tried to pull the boy’s trousers down as he washed his hands after using the toilet and when the boy would not let him the defendant allegedly asked him: ‘Why not? It’s fun.’ The court heard that in March last year the alleged victim was spoken to by teachers following rumours in the school that he had touched his girlfriend intimately. The boy claimed he made up the story to impress his friends, but it was while teachers were speaking to him about the issue that he accused the defendant of rape. That night he told his parents and the matter was reported to the police. The alleged victim told officers that the defendant was a bully in the playground. Mr Scholz said the complainant would not go into the playground during break times to avoid being picked on. The accused boy admitted to police that he had been mean to his classmate on occasions but said he had not bullied him. He told police he had never asked him for sex and nothing of sexual nature had ever happened between them. The defendant said he had asked the alleged victim once for a date but said it was a joke and later told him he had ‘dumped him’. The case continues. The Mail is campaigning for tighter controls on internet pornography. We reported on Monday that a new system is to be introduced in which users of UK-based porn websites will have to prove they are over 18.

She is expected to be arraigned on Monday at the Vista branch of San Diego County Superior Court . The other suspects in the killing are Maraglino's boyfriend, Louis Ray Perez, 45, a . Camp Pendleton Marine staff sergeant, and Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, who . was a roommate of Perez and Maraglino. Both have pleaded not guilty to . murder. During Perez's arraignment in April, prosecutors revealed that Killgore met him for a night out after she filed for divorce. Another woman was supposed to join them, but canceled last minute. During their date, however, something apparently went awry. ‘She sent a text saying, 'Help,'' said Patrick Espinoza, a deputy San Diego County district attorney. ‘She was missing from that point on.’ According to Espinoza, investigators found Killgore's blood and a weapon in Perez's car. He also said Perez told investigators he dropped off Killgore in downtown San Diego's Gaslamp District, but investigators concluded that he lied about his whereabouts and stayed about 60 miles north in Fallbrook, where Killgore lived. Authorities said Killgore's body was found hours after paramedics were called to a San Diego motel and found Lopez with self-inflicted cuts and a suicide note. Tragic: The body of Brittany Killgore was discovered on Tuesday, four days after she was last seen with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge . Suspect: Authorities believe that the victim knew Jessica Lynn Lopez (pictured here), and the two were involved in some kind of sex slave ring . While authorities would not elaborate . on the nature of the relationship between Lopez and the victim, Lopez's . neighbor claims she and Mrs Killgore were involved in a dangerous sex . ring, playing sex slaves. According to online profiles cited by the San Diego Union-Tribune, Perez and Maraglino were also involved in sadomasochism and bondage. The prosecutor said Lopez and . Perez once lived together but didn't indicate when or where. Lopez lives . a mile from Killgore's second-floor apartment overlooking Camp . Pendleton.It is still unclear how Killgore died. Cory Killgore has not been named as a suspect or person of interest in the killing. The couple married in July of 2010. Lopez's attorney Dean Broyles said he . didn't know if his client knew Perez or Mrs Killgore, who was reported . missing one day after Lopez turned 25. 'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said. 'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.' Suicide attempt: Jessica Lynn Lopez was found with numerous self-inflicted stab wounds on her body at this Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport . Estranged: Brittany Killgore, right, filed for divorce from husband Cory, left, last week . Lopez's parents, who live in nearby Escondido, . released a statement saying they loved their daughter. 'We . pray for the family of Brittany Killgore and ask that the Lord comfort . them during their time of grief and anguish,' the parents said. 'We ask that you pray for all of those impacted by this tragic situation, including our family.' Authorities have not disclosed Mrs Killgore, Lopez, and Perez are connected. A neighbour, who declined to be identified, told\\xa0ABC 10 that both Lopez and the victim took part in some kind of sex ring. She said: 'They're into the sex slave things... I try not to judge, but that's what they're into.' Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton US Marine base . Perez, 45, had initially pleaded not guilty to stealing a AR-15 rifle from Camp Pendleton, but was re-arrested on April 24 and charged with Killgore's death. Lopez's bail was set at $3 million. Mrs Killgore went missing shortly after . filing for divorce from her husband, Cory Killgore a 22-year-old Marine deployed to . Afghanistan. Her body was found in brush in Riverside . County about 25 miles northeast of her modest, two-story apartment in . Fallbrook, a San Diego County community known for its avocado orchards. Killgore lived a short walk from an . entrance to Camp Pendleton, and her complex - like others around it - is . full of Marines and their families who tend to be short-term residents . and often don't get to know each other well. Fears: Cory, right, is returning from Afghanistan after hearing about the disappearance of his wife, left . Killgore's husband, Lance Corporal . Cory Killgore, flew back to California after learning his wife was . missing. The couple from Missouri were married . in July 2010. Brittany Killgore filed for divorce April 10 and listed . 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason. She gave no details on the . paperwork. Her cellphone was found in the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego, an area populated with bars and restaurants. Darryl J Wrest of Rolla, Missouri, . confirmed Brittany Killgore is his daughter but said he was not . commenting on anything at this time. Killgore's other family members . also declined to comment. Authorities investigating the homicide said a suicide note . of the prime suspect contained key details about the case, including . the location of a body. Serious: The Fallbrook scene where Louis Ray Perez is being questioned in connection with the disappearance . Authorities in California are now reportedly examining a possible link between Killgore, the suspect, and a seedy sex ring. ABC 10 reported that officers later responded to a Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport, . where they found a woman with stab wounds all over her body in an . apparent suicide attempt. That woman, 25-year-old Lopez, was arrested at the scene but hospitalized at UCSD Medical Center. Cory Killgore was deployed to Afghanistan earlier this year as a vehicle operator. Since his wife's murder, Killgore has spoken . publicly about her just once, saying in a statement that she . was 'beautiful beyond words' and that he was 'devastated' by her loss, according to Patch. 'My duty to her memory is now to ensure her good reputation remains . intact, and help law enforcement and prosecutors secure justice for the . person or persons who took her away from me,' he said.\",\n",

The court heard that when Colm James Keogh was woken by mounted officers, he lashed out and punched a police horse twice in mouth in December. However, the 31-year-old has avoided conviction and instead has been placed on a good behaviour bond. Colm James Keogh was trying to sleep off a big night at a Christmas party dressed only in his underwear and one sock, an Australian court heard on Tuesday . Mr Keogh pleaded guilty in the Adelaide Magistrates Court to one count of disorderly behaviour over the incident last December. His original charge of ill-treating an animal and two counts of assaulting police were withdrawn. Mr Keogh's lawyer, Con O'Neill, told the court his client had left a Christmas party at the Hilton Hotel on South Road in Adelaide and remembered getting in a taxi. He then found himself 'sleeping it off' on Hindley Street in his underwear and wearing one sock. Mr Keogh next recalled mounted police telling him to wake up and get dressed. He admitted to punching a police horse which resulted in a swollen hand in the morning. Mr Keogh spent eight hours in custody and had been 'humiliated by the whole experience'. 'He looks back with shame and embarrassment. He’s from a culture which loves horses,' his lawyer said. The drunk Irishman was approached by mounted Adelaide police last December which is when he punched the police horse twice. Pictured are Adelaide police during a parade in 2006 . He described his client as 'a gentle giant' and his actions weren't deliberate. Mr O'Neill said Mr Keogh had alcohol problems but hadn't consumed any since the incident. 'It's not suggested in this case that there was any demonstrable harm cause to the horse, although it must have been discomforted,' the magistrate Paul Bennett said. 'December last year was a difficult time for you because you and your partner lost a child in very tragic circumstances in December 2010, so I understand when December comes around every year it's very sad.' Mr Keogh was put on a 15-month good behaviour bond, a $600 fine and ordered to pay legal costs. 'You accept that you were very intoxicated at the time,' Mr Bennett said. 'But there's no excuse for you in the fact that you were so intoxicated. It was in fact a shameful thing for you to do.' Mr Bennett said Mr Keogh had been seeing a psychologist since the offending. He said there was good reason to suspend the sentence. The police prosecutor said the incident had left police horse Viking with 'no lasting impact'. Unit Senior Sergeant Damien Eichner said Viking was on patrol that night as part of a police crackdown on alcohol-fuelled violence and anti-social behaviour, The Advertiser reported in February when Mr Keogh appeared in court. Senior Sergeant Eichner said attacks on police horses were uncommon and Viking had recovered well. Mr Keogh is hoping to apply for permanent residency for his family. It may not have been granted if he had a conviction recorded.\",\n",

For most children, getting their hands on an iPad is an opportunity to play games, watch videos and surf the internet. But at one primary school the Apple devices are being put to a more serious use – as a teaching tool for lessons in everything from maths to music. Thirty-two iPads have been bought at a cost of £13,000 so that a whole class can use them at the same time. Children as young as four are taking part. Hands-on learning: A junior class at North Crescent Primary School get to grips with their new educational tool . Lisa Wright, who is headmistress of North Crescent in Wickford, Essex, said the flexibility of the curriculum meant the iPads could be used right across the primary school. ‘Year Four children have used them in maths lessons and reception children have played some maths and phonics games,’ she said. ‘Year Ones had them in their religious education lesson and Year Five and Six pupils have been using iPads in their topics, such as learning about the Titanic by getting on the internet.’ The use of iPads is part of an overhaul of information and communications technology at the 214-pupil school. Mrs Wright added: ‘We bought the iPads because they’re so flexible and versatile. We’ve got a lovely outdoor space here so the children can take them outside and even use them to take pictures. Focus: The iPads are used by all year groups and in all subjects at the primary school . ‘We want learning to be fun for the children. The iPads are in use all the time. ‘If you walk around the school, there’s a child somewhere or a group using the iPad which is what I want to see.’ However, Mrs Wright insists books and conventional teaching methods such as pencil and paper are equally important. Thought: The school spent £13,000 on 32 of the expensive Apple tablet devices . Earlier this year, Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg claimed school textbooks could be replaced by devices. An Ofsted report last year said pupils were showing high degrees of concentration when doing mental arithmetic on handheld games consoles. But Dr Aric Sigman, a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine, has argued against a technology ‘free for all’. ‘Children first need to learn how to concentrate before they start dividing their attention up with different windows on a screen and different forms of entertainment,’ he said.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'The changes to Fox\\'s singing competition shows have only just begun. After weeks of dramatic headlines about \"Idol\\'s\" slipping ratings and \"Factor\\'s\" talent departures, Fox\\'s president of alternative entertainment Mike Darnell spoke to EW about the challenges faced by \"American Idol\" and \"The X Factor\" -- and his strategy for remaining on top. Given their large number of hours and consistent ability to win time periods, one could argue that \"Idol\" and \"Factor\" are the No. 1 network\\'s most important shows. So what does it mean when the bulk of the \"Factor\" cast abruptly gets pink-slipped and \"Idol\" has CBS\\' \"Big Bang Theory\" nipping at its heels on Thursday nights? With \"Factor\", the sudden exodus of host Steve Jones, judge Nicole â€ªScherzingerâ€¬ and executive producer Simon Cowell\\'s longtime TV-spouse Paula Abdul may have stunned observers (L.A. Reid will return). Yet the move was somewhat less surprising to followers of the UK version, which sheds judges every few seasons. In a genre where tough-love auditions are the heart of the format, Darnell described being a star on \"Factor\\'s\" debut as not entirely dissimilar to being a contestant. \"Season one was basically an audition act,\" said Darnell late last week. \"Simon got one big new star out of it -- L.A. Reid, and that was great casting. There\\'s going to be a natural reassessment.\" Viewers largely accepted the departure of Jones and â€ªScherzinger, yet the loss of Abdul raised concern. She may not have been the strongest contributor to the show, the reasoning went, but she didn\\'t seem to be an overt problem either. \"Paula was an interesting call,\" Darnell said. \"She and Simon are great friends, so it was just a dynamic conversation about what\\'s the nature of the group going to be. And I think we decided to pull the Band-Aid off as quickly as possible.\" Fox hopes to fill the spots over the next several months. It\\'s reasonable to expect the network will pursue big music stars, with the caveat that prospective judges also should also have workable chemistry with Cowell. The bottom line is that Fox wants to take a show that was already typically winning its night and find every way possible to improve it -- including brainstorming creative changes apart from the on-air talent. \"There definitely will be lots of different changes in the show,\" Darnell said. That said, Darnell dismissed one TV critic complaint that the show seemed \"inauthentic.\" \"That\\'s the kind of stuff that pundits talk about that doesn\\'t mean anything to the audience,\" he said. \"It was a very consistent audience for that show. The audience that stuck with the show loved it.\" Over on \"Idol,\" Darnell faces the trickier challenge of keeping an 11-year-old hit feeling fresh and compelling without altering its popular fundamentals. Asked why \"Idol\\'s\" ratings have softened, Darnell agreed with TV analysts who point to the flood of singing competition shows. Idol used to be an annual event. Now there\\'s wide-eyed young singers, brutal judges and suspenseful eliminations on TV all year around. The other programs include Fox\\'s own \"Factor,\" of course (when Cowell decided to launch a U.S. version of his UK hit, Fox had little choice but to get on board, lest risk losing him to a rival network). \"There\\'s no question there\\'s a glut of [singing competition shows that are] affecting the numbers for Idol,\" Darnell said. \"It\\'s the granddaddy, it\\'s run is unprecedented. I think that considering all the other shows and its age, it\\'s doing quite well. Having both shows on our air has put us in an incredibly strong position as a network.\" \"Idol\" is still a No. 1 for the season and averages about 20 million viewers a week. While \"Big Bang\" and ABC\\'s \"Modern Family\" are closing the gap, \"Idol\" generates more than 50 hours per season compared to roughly 11 for half-hour comedies (no drama series come close to Idol\\'s numbers). Like with the recent \"Factor\" headlines, Fox has weathered plenty of second-guessing media coverage over the past several years of \"Idol\" panel changes. Some pundits predicted Cowell exiting the show two years ago would be a fatal blow, especially since the ratings were already declining. Yet when looking at the ratings, \"Idol\" changes over the years seemed to help offset audience erosion. \"Idol\" typically only dropped about 10-12 percent each season despite its age, often returned better than most industry observers expected. After last year\\'s well-received addition of judges Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez, making further alterations would have appeared foolish -- why fix a show that wasn\\'t broken? But with the new season\\'s ratings down more than 20 percent, it raises the question: Is \"Idol\" at a point where it now requires major changes each season to keep fans\\' interest? Though making a judgement on next year\\'s \"Idol\" panel is months away, Darnell noted viewers can expect to see some twists this season. \"There\\'s always freshening up,\" he said. \"We\\'ve done rule changes, we\\'ve eliminated the middle rounds, we put in the judges\\' \\'save.\\' And there will be some changes coming to the show this year that no one knows about yet, [though] they\\'re more modest than last year. What you try to do generally is if you have a year of big changes, you try to let those settle for at least another year. Change can help, or it can kill you if it\\'s the wrong change. You never want to change the core of the show, no matter what the competition is doing, because that\\'s what people come back for.\" One frequent point of viewer debate is the number of good auditions vs. humorously bad auditions. As with every aspect of his shows, Darnell has given the matter plenty of thought and experimented with different possibilities. \"We used to have more bad than good,\" he said. \"Over the last three years we\\'ve gone the opposite direction. I think it\\'s a balancing act. One of the things that separate \\'Idol\\' from the other shows is that we have the fun and funny auditions, that\\'s why those [opening weeks] numbers are usually big. If you go too far in one direction or the other, that\\'s a mistake. And you have to be careful about which bad auditions are shown. The William Hungs of the world work, but people dressed as bananas don\\'t. They have to be sincere auditions.\" And if the unthinkable happens. If \"Idol,\" after eight seasons as TV\\'s top-rated entertainment program, should slip ... Darnell predicted the network -- and the show -- will survive just fine. \"It would be nice to reign forever as No. 1,\" Darnell said. \"But if \\'Idol\\' ever becomes a second- or third-place show, it still has a much bigger impact and value than most other shows because it accounts for so many more hours. Obviously all shows come down, but to still be at this level is amazing, and we\\'re really grateful for that.\" See the full article at EW.com.

For \"The X Factor,\" the sudden exit of host Steve Jones, judge Nicole Scherzinger, and Paula Abdul has raised concerns, but Darnell sees it as a natural reassessment. He described the first season as an \"audition act\" and emphasized the need to improve the show, including potential changes beyond the on-air talent. Darnell dismissed criticisms about the show\\'s authenticity, noting that the core audience remained loyal.\\n\\nOn \"American Idol,\" Darnell acknowledged the impact of the glut of singing competition shows, which has softened \"Idol\\'s\" ratings. Despite this, \"Idol\" remains a top-rated show, averaging about 20 million viewers per week. Darnell highlighted the show\\'s resilience, noting that it has maintained its audience through various changes over the years. He promised some modest changes for the current season to keep the show fresh, emphasizing the importance of not altering the core elements that fans love.

U.S. airlines collected $3.5 billion in baggage fees and $2.6 billion in reservation change/cancellation fees last year, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data. That was a 3.8% increase in baggage fees and a 7.8% increase in reservation change/cancellation fees compared with 2011. Delta Air Lines came out on top in baggage and reservation change/cancellation fees, collecting $1.6 billion last year. Delta's baggage fees totaled $865.9 million and it collected $778.4 million in change/cancellation fees. United Airlines landed in second place in both categories, with $705.5 million in baggage fees and $660.9 million reservation change/cancellation fees. And the most satisfying airline is ... Those fees returned the airlines to profitability in 2012. Total revenue for all passenger airlines last year was $159.5 billion, while total operating expenses were $153.6 billion. For the 10 largest U.S. airlines, that translated into net income of $201 million last year, up from a $500,000 loss in 2011. And there's no sign that the fees are going away. Delta, United, American Airlines and US Airways recently raised the cost of changing a reservation from $150 to $200 for many nonrefundable tickets for domestic flights. Frontier Airlines will soon start charging a $25 to $100 carry-on bag fee to many customers who book their tickets through third-party sites, excluding certain members of its frequent flier program. American was the first U.S. airline to charge customers for the first bag checked, starting in June 2008. The fee was $15, and other airlines quickly followed suit. That year, American collected $277,991 in baggage fees, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data. The U.S. airlines collected $1.1 million that year.\",\n",

Mr Miliband, often mocked by satirists as looking like a character from the popular animated series Wallace and Gromit, seems to have had his features enhanced highlighting the resemblance.

Scroll down for video . Vicious: The Conservative poster appears to distort Ed Miliband's features (left). It also shows him embracing Alec Salmond and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams (right) Pat Doherty, the Sinn Fein MP for West Tyrone, told Channel 4 News he is ‘regularly badgered’ by shadow cabinet members about whether they would join a a coalition government led by Labour if it did not win enough seats to pass laws in the House of Commons. ‘They bring it up quite bluntly and it’s always dealt with in the same way,’ he said. David Cameron brought up the issued at Prime Ministers’ Questions yesterday, saying: ‘We have seen Labour casting around for a coalition with the SNP and a coalition with Sinn Fein - the first time Britain would have people who want to break up Britain and bankrupt Britain. What a useless shower.’ Tory MP Ben Wallace, who served in Northern Ireland with the Scots Guards, said: ‘So desperate is Ed Miliband to get the keys to No 10, he would do a deal with the people who tried to blow it up.’ The poster carries the headline: ‘Your worst nightmare…just got even worse’ over two pictures, one of a grinning Ed Miliband in Downing Street, a second with him alongside former SNP leader Mr Salmond and Mr Adams.

For as long as Milke has been incarcerated, she and her mother have only met in situations where they were separated by glass. 'They were never able to touch,' Mr Krucker said. A . dozen years ago, Mr Krucker was among the organizers of an effort in the . Swiss town of Emmetten to support Milke, including by establishing a . bank account that collected donations to aid in her defense. The account . eventually netted about 200,000 Swiss francs, or about $213,000 today. It's now nearly drained, he said. Tragic: Christopher Milke, seen here with his mother Debra, was shot in the head three times. He was just 4 years old . Doubts about Milke's guilt and suspicion about the reliability of the detective's testimony helped motivate Swiss supporters to donate, as did opposition to the death penalty. Many also had concerns that Milke didn't have access to the best defense because she had too little money, he said. Now supporters . are excited about the prospect of her release, Mr Krucker said, but also . worried how she will manage to pay the bond. Ms Janka, who is suffering from cancer, was already forced to sell her home to help cover her daughter's legal bills, he said. Supporters also run a website that requests donations through both German and Swiss accounts. Milke's . ex-husband, Arizona Milke, believes his former wife is . guilty and that supporters are fooled by the postings on the website. Killers: Jim Styers and Roger Scott admitted to murdering Christopher, and both currently are on death row . 'It's fed by propagandized lies,' he said on Friday. 'They write whatever they want and put it up there like it's true.' Her . chance at freedom comes six months after a federal appeals court . overturned Milke's conviction, ruling that the prosecution should have . disclosed information about the truthfulness of the now-retired . detective who testified that Milke confessed. Milke . was a 25-year-old insurance company clerk when her son was killed. She . has maintained her innocence, saying she had nothing to do with the . slaying. The two men . convicted in the case both remain on death row. Neither Roger Scott nor . former Milke roommate James Styers testified at Milke's trial. Scott . confessed during a police interrogation and led detectives to the boy's . body. Maricopa County . prosecutors are still seeking the death penalty against Milke at her . retrial, tentatively set for Sept. 30, and her alleged confession is at . the heart of the case against her. Police . detective Armando Saldate Jr. testified that she confessed to him in a . closed interrogation room. But the confession was not recorded. 'Confession': Detective Armando Saldate claims Milke confessed to her involvement in the murder - but it wasn't recorded and nobody witnessed it - other than Saldate . At trial, Milke denied that she had confessed, but the jury believed the detective. Doubts . about Saldate's honesty arose during Milke's appeals. The 9th Circuit . concluded in March that prosecutors' failure to turn over evidence . related to Saldate's credibility deprived Milke's attorneys of the . chance to question his truthfulness before jurors. 'No . civilized system of justice should have to depend on such flimsy . evidence, quite possibly tainted by dishonesty or overzealousness, to . decide whether to take someone's life or liberty,' Chief Judge Alex . Kozinski wrote for the court. The . court noted four cases in which judges threw out confessions or . indictments because Saldate lied under oath and four instances in which . cases were tossed out or confessions excluded because Saldate violated . the suspect's constitutional rights. Crime scene: This cross marks the spot in the Arizona desert where Christopher Milke was ruthlessly murdered . He . was also suspended for accepting sexual favors from a female motorist . he stopped and then lying about the encounter, the court said. Deputy . County Attorney Vince Imbordino argued last week during a bond hearing . that the purported confession is still admissible, but Judge Rosa Mroz . of Maricopa County Superior Court said the undisclosed material . concerning Saldate 'casts serious doubt' on its validity. Mroz, . who also set Milke's bond, scheduled a September 23 hearing on the . defense's request to prohibit the prosecution from using the confession . during the retrial.\",\n",

Walters said Sheherazad Jaafari contacted her following the reporter\\'s return from Syria to the United States after a December ABC interview with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Sheherazad Jaafari had coached al-Assad before the interview on how to describe the violence there, according to e-mails purportedly from Syrian officials released in February by the hacking group known as Anonymous. \"Don\\'t talk reform,\" she wrote in one e-mail. \"American\\'s (sic) won\\'t care, or understand that. ... American psyche can be easily manipulated when they hear that there are \\'mistakes\\' done and now we are \\'fixing it.\\'\" On her resume, Jaafari said she graduated from college in June 2010 and worked for a year as an account executive at Brown Lloyd James, a public relations firm, in New York. Sheherazad Jaafari said Wednesday that she had met a number of English-speaking journalists during a three-month, unpaid internship she undertook late last year in Syria while preparing to return to school to pursue her master\\'s degree. \"My main intention as a new graduate was to expose myself to the world of media and communication, which are the fields that I have interest in,\" she said in an e-mail to CNN. \"Unfounded reports published recently have wrongfully claimed that I was the aide of the President of Syria. I want to make clear that I have never served as a President aid (sic) to the President of Syria,\" she continued.\" She added, \"I am nothing but a victim for some personal agendas.\" Sheherazad Jaafari said that she gained admission to Columbia based on her own qualifications. What is occurring in Syria \"and to my people saddens me and breaks my heart. It is in my prayers that peace and stability will prevail.\" In e-mails obtained by CNN, she struck a personal tone toward the Syrian president. \"I miss ur voice already,\" she wrote al-Assad in late December. \"Give me a call whenever u can so I could get some energy from you and tell you how much I misss u (sic).\" Walters has said that Jaafari was \"looking for a job\" when she contacted her. \"I told her that was a serious conflict of interest and that we would not hire her. I did offer to mention her to contacts at another media organization and in academia.\" Walters sent an e-mail to CNN\\'s Piers Morgan and his executive producer, Jonathan Wald, describing her as a \"sensational young woman.\" CNN has said Walters contacted \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" on Jaafari\\'s behalf; however, she was neither interviewed nor hired as an intern. Morgan himself denied having had any contact with Jaafari. Walters also e-mailed a professor at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism on Jaafari\\'s behalf. The professor, former ABC News executive Richard Wald, is the father of Jonathan Wald. Walters later sent a follow-up e-mail to Jonathan Wald, advising him not to bother following up with the college graduate, since she did not have an appropriate U.S. visa. Howard Kurtz, the host of CNN\\'s \"Reliable Sources,\" said the incident makes Walters \"seem a little too cozy\" with someone close to the Syrian regime. \"This looks like a bit of a quid pro quo,\" Kurtz said last week. \"This woman was close to Assad, the daughter of the ambassador, helps her arrange the interview, and the next day they\\'re on e-mail talking about helping her -- Barbara Walters helping her to either get into an Ivy League school or land a media internship.\"',\n",

The secrecy surrounding the selection of the pontiff and the pomp accompanying the announcement from the balcony produce the kind of drama that rivets the world even in an age of technological distraction. Who isn\\'t awed by the sights and sounds of a hundred-thousand people gathered in St. Peter\\'s Square, awaiting and then greeting the man chosen to lead 1.2 billion people? Opinion: A humble, authentic and credible pope . Just as we are meant to be affected by religious stagecraft, we are also practically hardwired to seek the meaning in a leader\\'s every move. When Francis visited Santa Maria Maggiore he met briefly with Cardinal Bernard Law, who recently stepped down as archpriest of the basilica. A decade ago, when he was archbishop of Boston, Law was a notorious figure in the scandal that arose around the sexual abuse of children by priests. As scores of victims accused him of failing to protect children from predatory priests, he became the only bishop to resign because of the abuse crisis; he then fled to Rome. But while many Boston Catholics consider Law a disgraced figure, his fellow bishops have continued to respect him and, in reaching out to him, Pope Francis appeared to echo this solidarity. Opinion: Pope Francis is no herald of big changes . This can be seen as a reminder to the world that the Catholic Church remains under the control of men who were appointed to high office by the archconservatives John Paul II and Benedict XVI and share a commitment to the orthodoxies that have alienated so many modern Catholics. On the status of women, priestly celibacy, contraception and sexuality, Francis is as firmly rooted in the past as his predecessors. For example, during the debate that eventually resulted in gays in Argentina being allowed to marry, then-Archbishop Bergoglio mounted a fierce campaign against this equality. He argued that Satan himself was the author of a reform he called \"a machinization of the \\'Father of Lies\\',\" and that children and families would be harmed by the change. While he was archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio spoke often of the poor and called attention to the many ways that modern societies push people without status to the margins. In this way, he reflected Christ\\'s affiliation with the outcasts of his time. However, even as he spoke for the powerless, Bergoglio also consistently aligned himself with powerful conservative politicians seeking to oust the government headed first by Nestor Kirchner and later by his wife, the current President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, and which enjoyed wide support from the middle and lower classes. Time and again he invoked God in his political campaigns and suggested the other side was somehow less holy. As he engaged in politics, Bergoglio emphasized the special status claimed by the church as an agent of his God, which, he implied, makes it superior to all other institutions. When he became Pope Francis, Bergoglio expressed the same sentiment in his very first formal remarks, delivered at the Sistine Chapel. There he warned that without emphasizing its religious base the church runs the risk of becoming \"a pitiful NGO\" (nongovernmental organization). Navarrette: Pope pick a signal to Latino Catholics . For those who respect NGOs such as Amnesty International and the Red Cross, Francis\\' choice of words -- \"pitiful NGO\" -- was a stinging reminder that this man with the humble style cannot resist claiming superiority based on supernatural beliefs. This is the great contradiction of the new pope. On the one hand he criticizes hypocrisy in the church and shows his discomfort with the trappings of power. On the other, he shows disdain for social institutions and leaders that compete with the church for influence and authority. The dichotomy represented by the values espoused by Christianity and an imperial church is what makes so many people uncomfortable with official Catholicism. Francis embodies this conflict. Stylistically, the world is getting a far more approachable, Christ-like man who understands the compassion and empathy people crave from spiritual leaders. However, Francis\\' record appears to indicate there will be no real changes where it matters -- on the status of women, power-sharing, sexual ethics -- and thus huge numbers of Catholics will remain alienated. The biggest risk the Church faces today is irrelevance, and while the new pope\\'s style means he\\'ll get a hearing, what he has to say about issues that matter the most is unlikely to make the institution any more relevant than it was before him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael D\\'Antonio .',\n",

              "  {'content': 'Pope Francis, Jorge Bergoglio, has quickly demonstrated a down-to-earth and approachable demeanor, reminiscent of figures like the Dalai Lama and Bishop Desmond Tutu. On his first full day as pope, he visited the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica and paid his hotel bill, actions that underscore his humility. However, his interactions, such as meeting Cardinal Bernard Law, a controversial figure linked to the clergy sexual abuse scandal, highlight the conservative roots of the Catholic Church. Francis, like his predecessors, adheres to traditional stances on issues such as women\\'s roles, priestly celibacy, contraception, and sexuality. While he has a strong record of advocating for the poor and marginalized, he has also aligned himself with conservative political forces in Argentina. His warning against the church becoming a \"pitiful NGO\" reflects a belief in the church\\'s superior status. This duality—between his compassionate style and traditional views—poses a significant challenge. Despite his approachable manner, the lack of substantive changes on key issues may continue to alienate many Catholics, risking the church\\'s relevance in the modern world.',\n",

In Whitehall, the publication of the documents stolen by Edward Snowden is considered to have done more damage to the security services than any other event in history. Feted as a hero by The Guardian, Snowden said he wanted to start a public debate on the widespread use of eavesdropping techniques by GCHQ and his former employer, the US National Security Agency (NSA). But security officials are adamant there was no public interest in publishing top-secret information which details the precise methods used by agents to track terrorist plots. They argue that – by pointing out which internet service providers, phone companies and other technology firms can be effectively monitored by GCHQ – fanatics were signposted to the places they should avoid when communicating. GCHQ, in Cheltenham, is the organisation which gathers intelligence for both MI5 and MI6 – if it is compromised, so is the entire security apparatus of the country. One Government official said that, in effect, The Guardian had helped to produce a ‘handbook’ for terrorists. The internet is now rich with websites, based on the newspaper’s revelations, that explain the best way to communicate, while avoiding detection. Whitehall insiders are scornful of the idea that The Guardian and Snowden – who is now holed up in Russia, after a whistle-stop visit to the Chinese territory of Hong Kong – needed to start a debate on State surveillance. They point out that, for years, controversy has raged over (so far unsuccessful) attempts to give the security services and police more powers to spy on emails and internet visits, via the so-called snoopers’ charter.

Former NSA employee Edward Snowden. Some of the information was so sensitive that British agents had to be moved for their own safety . It is also highly likely that China and Russia hold the information, given Snowden’s attempts to seek sanctuary there. In August, Oliver Robbins, deputy national security adviser at the Cabinet Office, warned the lives of British agents may have been put at risk by Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald and his partner David Miranda. Mr Miranda was stopped by police at Heathrow airport on his way from Germany to the couple’s home in Brazil. It later emerged that his flights had been paid for by The Guardian, and he was transporting nine hard disks and memory sticks, including secret files leaked by Snowden. Some of the information – there were at least 58,000 documents in his possession – was so sensitive that British agents had to be moved for their own safety. Mr Robbins said the material was likely to contain details of secret techniques used to prevent terror attacks, personal data about agents at home and abroad and ‘other intelligence activities vital to UK national security’. At the time, Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian, branded the claims ‘unsubstantiated and inaccurate’.

The decision to axe the carbon, introduced by the former Labor government, was a key election promise made by Prime Minister Tony Abbott during the 2013 election campaign. It was repealed in July - two years after it was introduced. Mr Abbott planned to replace the carbon tax with industry incentives to use cleaner energy.\",\n",

Eric Pickles has attacked a council for spending nearly £700,000 on translation services for immigrants. The Communities Secretary said the money should have been spent on frontline services and keeping the council tax down in Sheffield. The council spent £555,331 on face-to-face and phone translation from 2011 to 2014, and £131,785 on documents. Some of the 44 languages translated include little-used Dari, Karen, Lingala, Oromo and Tigrinya. In 2013, Mr Pickles told all councils to stop translating documents as it was rarely needed and discouraged migrants from learning English. He said: 'The Government guidance I've issued is crystal clear, councils should stop wasting taxpayers' money by translating into foreign languages. 'Translation holds people back from integrating into British society - if they can't speak English, they're not going to get on in life. 'This shows how political correctness does more harm than good. The money used can be used to protect frontline services and keep council tax down. 'Such translation services have an unintentional, adverse impact on integration by reducing the incentive for some migrant communities to learn English and are wasteful where many members of these communities already speak or understand English.' Sheffield Council said the costs mostly relate to services it has to legally provide, like child protection and housing, and translating leaflets was not standard practice. A council spokesman said the bulk of its costs are linked to providing services that it has to provide by law. Frontline services: Communities secretary Eric Pickles has attacked Sheffield City Council for spending nearly £700,000 on translation services for immigrants at the expense of frontline services . 'Whilst we have reduced the costs of providing interpretation significantly in recent years under law we are required to ensure that children are safeguarded and where interpretation is needed to do this we have to provide it to ensure we have met our obligations. 'We restrict translation and interpretation services to essential matters such as signs up and serving legal notices. We always review how we can reduce our costs and this is something we have been doing for some time. 'We do not print leaflets in different languages as standard practice.'\",\n",

Hair straighteners are causing 'horrific injuries' to hundreds of young children across the UK, a safety charity has warned. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said at one hospital in Northern Ireland, one in 10 of children admitted with burns, had been injured by the beauty device with some needing plastic surgery. Hair straighteners can reach scorching temperatures of 220C - hot enough to fry an egg. As they take 40 minutes to cool they remain dangerously hot for far longer than many parents realise. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hair straighteners reach temperatures of 200C and most commonly cause hand injuries among children . Youngsters who grab or fall on them can suffer disfiguring injuries as their skin is up to 15 times thinner than adults. Figures released by the Royal Belfast for Sick Children show that 17 children aged between three months and nine years attended A&E at the hospital in 2009-10 with hair straightener burns. The average age of the patient was just 18months. They represented nine per cent of the 187 children who attended with 'thermal injuries' during that year. In June this year, the Frenchay Hospital in Bristol revealed is had . treated 110 children for serious burns in the last five years. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents have urged parents to remember the three S's... SWITCH hair . straighteners off and unplug them straight away . SLIDE them into a . heat resistant bag . STORE them out of the sight and reach of children . They add to take care not to burn yourself when using straighteners by making sure you don't place them too close to your scalp or ears. Across the UK this would add up to hundreds of serious injuries every year, with thousands more receiving minor injuries. Children are most likely to receive burns to their hands, however children have also sustained injuries to the head, arm and foot. Nicola Vance, a mother from Belfast, . revealed her 19-month old toddler was injured after falling onto her . straighteners a year ago just after she had switched them off. Although . she whisked him away, just a couple of seconds did serious damage. She said: 'Alfie has just learned to . shuffle so he was moving along the bed, he caught himself in the sheets . and just fell forward onto the straighteners. 'The . middle of his eyebrows was all red and his skin had melted. If the . straighteners had been any hotter, they would have peeled off his . forehead. 'Alfie was lucky that he didn't lose his eyes, although he has been scarred for life.' Now RoSPA are working with the . Belfast Health and Social Care Trust on a 'Too Hot to Handle Campaign' to raise awareness of the risks. Alfie Vance received facial burns after he fell onto his mother's straighteners . Sheila Merrill, RoSPA’s public health . adviser, said: 'The campaign in Northern Ireland builds on other . awareness-raising work that RoSPA has been carrying out across the UK. 'We . know from reports and from talking to the people who work in A&E . that burns from hair straighteners is a significant issue and a national . problem. 'And yet the . risks posed are so easy to reduce. Simply by putting these devices into . heat resistant bags after use, and storing them in a place that’s out of . the sight and reach of children, we can go a long way to preventing the . kind of burns which can scar for life.' The campaign has created\\xa0a video to show just how hot straighteners can become. Dr Julie-Ann Maney, consultant . in paediatric emergency medicine at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick . Children, said: 'Hair straightener burns are preventable. The Too Hot to . Handle campaign will highlight how dangerous these devices are, . particularly to small children and that the public need to be aware of . the horrific injuries that can be sustained.' Phil Buckle, director general at the . Electrical Safety Council, said: “The ESC is delighted to support the . Too Hot to Handle campaign.

              "  {'content': 'The Berlin Wall came down 20 years ago and in that time the world game has opened its arms to a tidal wave of talent from behind the former Iron Curtain. Czech Republic midfielder Pavel Nedved has spent almost 15 years at the top of European football. Here, Football Fanzone picks the 11 finest footballers to emerge from the old Eastern Bloc since 1989. Let us know what you think of our selection in the Sound Off box below. 1 Pavel Nedved (Czech Republic) Nedved, who has announced his retirement at the end of the season, has become Mr. Czech Republic in the eyes of football fans of the last 20 years. And this is for a country not short on talented players -- Vladimir Smicer, Karel Poborsky, Jan Koller and Tomas Rosicky to name but four. His breakthrough came at Euro 96, after which he signed for Lazio; four years later he was nothing short of inspirational for the Czechs at Euro 2000. When Zinedine Zidane left Juventus for Real Madrid in 2001, the Old Lady paid a staggering $54M for Nedved. It proved to be an inspired move: The midfielder, with his flowing hair, thunderbolt shot and all-action style, proved an able replacement. Now 36, he is one of Europe\\'s finest players of the last 20 years. 2 Gheorghe Hagi (Romania) Romania\\'s most famous footballer, Hagi was known as the \"Maradona of the Carpathians\" during a 16-year international career. Blessed with a left foot from the gods, the audacious midfielder could dance past opponents at will and he would shoot from anywhere -- witness his goal at World Cup 1994 against Colombia, a swirling, dipping strike from 40 yards. At club level, Hagi played for both Real Madrid and Barcelona and is still idolized in Turkey for his achievements with Galatasaray from 1996 until his retirement in 2001. Hagi, who was a member of Pele\\'s 125 top living footballers, holds the record for most goals for his country. 3 Andriy Shevchenko (Ukraine) Shevchenko might now be considered one of the game\\'s great goal scorers, but things might have been very different had he not been evacuated with his family in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. After starring for Dynamo Kiev alongside Sergiy Rebrov -- and scoring a hat-trick in the Nou Camp against Barcelona in the Champions League -- Shevchenko earned a move to AC Milan in 1999. At the San Siro, Shevchenko scored at will, so it was a big surprise that he flopped so badly after an eye-watering $43M move to Chelsea in 2006. A return to Milan has not revived his career, but 127 goals in 208 games from 1999-06 ensures his legacy is intact. Have we missed one of your favorites out? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. 4 Matthias Sammer (Germany) Elegance personified, Sammer\\'s career high point came at 1996 in a Germany side that would go on to lift the European Championship trophy. Sammer could play in midfield or as a \"libero\" and it was in the latter role that he underscored just how good he was. Time after time, Sammer brought the ball out of defense, echoing Franz Beckenbauer\\'s peerless ability to start attacks from the back. He was named European Footballer of the Year in 1996. One of the first notable East German players to join a Western club after German reunification, Sammer signed for Stuttgart from Dynamo Dresden in 1990. He went on to play for Inter Milan before returning to help Borussia Dortmund win the 1997 Champions League. 5 Hristo Stoichkov (Bulgaria) Stoichkov was an explosive left-sided attacker and remains the finest player to emerge from Bulgaria, Berbatov included. \"The Raging Bull\" was not just explosive for his speed off the mark and trademark free-kicks; he also had a short fuse and wore his heart on his sleeve. While playing for Barcelona, he was given a two-month ban for stomping on a referee\\'s foot, and his rows with coaches, including Johan Cruyff, were legendary. But these only added to his reputation as a fan\\'s favorite at the nine clubs he played for in a 21-year career. His six goals at the 1994 World Cup gave him a share of the golden boot, and the European Footballer of the Year accolade followed later that year. 6 Michael Ballack (Germany) No one swans around the pitch better than Ballack, who, at 32, is still Germany\\'s star player. Having impressed at Bayer Leverkusen during their brilliant but ultimately fruitless 2001-02 season, Bayern Munich swooped. By that time, Ballack had become the key man for the national side for his ability to control play from the middle of the park and score goals. He did the same for Bayern until 2006 when Chelsea signed him on a free transfer. Ballack has never replicated his international form in West London, but he has been confirmed as Germany captain for the 2010 World Cup. 7 Petr Cech (Czech Republic) In Cech, the Czech Republic can lay claim to the world\\'s best goalkeeper. Tall and commanding yet alert and agile, his glaring mistake at last summer\\'s European Championships, which resulted in Turkey\\'s progressing at the Czechs\\' expense, was a rare blip in his short trophy-laden career. Rennes spotted him playing for Sparta Prague while he was still a teenager in 2002 and two years later moneybags Chelsea spent $10M on him -- a fee that now looks like a bargain. After helping Chelsea to back-to-back Premier League titles, Cech fractured his skull in 2006, but he has returned -- headgear and all -- just as good. Only 26, his best years are ahead of him. 8 Dimitar Berbatov (Bulgaria) Berbatov was always one of Europe\\'s semi-hidden gems while he was plying his trade for Bayer Leverkusen. After scoring a goal every other game for CSKA Sofia in his homeland, Berbatov made the move to Germany until Tottenham Hotspur signed him in 2006. His touch, vision, movement, skill, strength and goal scoring prowess made it seem likely he would move on to a more successful club. And so it proved when Manchester United paid $44M in 2008. The languid Berbatov has yet to set Old Trafford alight but 41 goals in 67 appearances for Bulgaria speaks volumes for his class. 9 Alexander Hleb (Belarus) Is there a more delicate player in world football? Such a wonderful talent, but one capable of driving fans and doubtless teammates to distraction at times. Hleb\\'s assets are also his weaknesses -- a deft touch, two feet, dribbling ability, an elusive style and a keen eye for a pass, especially the killer one. But on an off day, he can be frustratingly ineffective. Given he is now at Barcelona, though, it\\'s fair to say the Belarusian forward has talent. He showed it plenty of times for Arsenal, although he didn\\'t find the net as often as he should have. Tall and wiry, Hleb came to the fore as Stuttgart\\'s creative force before the Gunners paid $15M for him in 2005. 10 Andrey Arshavin (Russia) Like Berbatov, Arshavin has been a late bloomer. Arshavin was little known outside Russia in his early days but he shot to prominence in 2007-08, when he was the inspiration behind Zenit St Petersburg\\'s UEFA Cup triumph. Arshavin then demonstrated his wonderful dribbling and playmaking abilities at Euro 2008 for a Russian side beaten only by eventual winners Spain. The pint-sized Arshavin had been linked with moves to Europe\\'s biggest clubs for a while but it was Arsenal who made the deal happen -- after much wrangling -- in 2009. 11 Adrian Mutu (Romania) Unfortunately for Mutu, his career will forever be tarnished by his dismissal by Chelsea for testing positive for cocaine in 2004 and his subsequent ban from the game. Up to that point, he was a star on the ascent. Prolific for Dinamo Bucharest, Mutu was snapped up by Internazionale in 2000, but it took moves to Verona and then Parma for him to begin to shine. Skillful and tricky, Mutu\\'s move to Chelsea in 2003 looked like a perfect move for both parties and after a difficult first season the striker was beginning to justify his $21.5M fee. Then came the failed drug test. Subsequent moves to Juventus and Fiorentina, where he has scored freely, have helped his career recover.',\n",

Mr Stoupin spent four months photographing corals and due to the complexity of the techniques he used, would spend up to 10 hours to produce one or two images . Some of the pieces were no bigger than 2cm and high magnification was needed, such as to capture this Blastomussa coral with its intriguing microscopic spines . However, to capture the rainbow of colours, a special torch was used to light up the corals. According to Mr Stoupin, an advanced full-spectrum light, rather than normal white light from a torch, allows the different colours to be made visible. He said: 'Corals, even the biggest ones, have details, which would escape our attention. The marine biology student used an advanced full-spectrum light, rather than normal white light from a torch, to photograph the different colours in this sample of Blue-Crlimrph coral in all its glory . He originally planned on photographing coral underwater, but knew he would need precise motion and a camera positioned on something solid, which is next to impossible underwater . 'I thought that corals would be especially fascinating but the technique requires precise motion and the camera has to be positioned on something solid, which is next to impossible underwater. 'However, capturing the colours was my second reason to go for studio photography instead of diving. 'Many representatives of marine life possess fluorescent pigments, which are responsible for their colour, but they don't reflect light similarly to substances that are familiar to us. Mr Stoupin said many representatives of marine life possess fluorescent pigments, which are responsible for their colour, but they don't reflect light similarly to substances that are familiar to us. This fragment of reverse prism favia coral almost appears to glow . Under a normal white torch light most corals like this spiky coral would look brown and colourless but the moment you shine full-spectrum light on them, they light up with an entire rainbow of colours, according to Mr Stoupin . 'For example, grass is green because it reflects green light whereas a fluorescent pigment is capable of transforming blue light from the water into green. 'Thus a coral can be green even when there's no green light to reflect,' he explained. Mr Stoupin said: 'Under a normal white torch light most corals would look brown and colourless but the moment you shine full-spectrum light on them, they light up with an entire rainbow of colours.'\",\n",

Stoupin gained access to studios owned by aquarists and coral collectors to photograph these intricate corals, which are primarily from the Great Barrier Reef and other reefs around Australia. He chose studio photography over underwater dives to employ advanced techniques and achieve high magnification, spending up to 10 hours to produce one or two images. Using a full-spectrum light, Stoupin was able to highlight the corals' fluorescent pigments, which transform blue light into a spectrum of vibrant colors. This method reveals details that would otherwise be invisible under normal white light, showcasing the corals' complex and beautiful structures. The process, which took four months, involved photographing fragments as small as 2 cm, resulting in images that look more like exotic plants or intricate patterns rather than marine life.\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"Thousands of people have taken to social media sites to declare their support of Christopher Dorner who has become an anti-hero since his death, according to experts. More than 20,000 people have 'liked' a Facebook group called We Stand With Christopher Dorner, while thousands more have taken to Twitter under the banner of 'Teamdorner'. By yesterday afternoon, there were 4,000 original posts using that hashtag. Scroll down for video . Thousands of people have 'lionized' Christopher Dorner since the manhunt was launched last week and his death . Experts say people are attracted to the ex-Los Angeles Police Department because he was an underdog and compared the week-long manhunt as like watching a real-life Django Unchained. Some conspiracy theorists were still speculating today that Dorner, 33, who was accused of killing four people, is still alive and fled to Mexico or faked his own death. Supporters have seized Dormer's 15,000-word manifesto as proof he was a man seeking justice. In it, Dorner describes being a victim of racism and claims he was fired from the LAPD for trying to expose corruption and brutality within the force. Marc Lamont Hill, associate professor of English at Columbia University, said Dorner has become a 'real-life superhero to many people.' He told CNN: 'People aren't rooting for him to kill innocent people, they're rooting for somebody who was wronged to get a kind of revenge against the system. 'It is almost like watching Django Unchained in real life.' Experts say Dorner's antihero status has fuelled support. Supporters such as Chantel Cardiel, pictured, stood with signs pleading with Los Angeles police not to kill Dorner . The story has exposed anger from some people about alleged police corruption and brutality . The biggest US manhunt in recent memory began after Dorner allegedly killed Keith Lawrence, 27, and Monica Quan, 28, the daughter of a police captain who assisted Dorner during his disciplinary hearings in 2007. Four days later he allegedly shot two officers in Riverside, California, killing one and injuring another. He went on the run for five days before the firefight at a cabin in Big Bear where Dorner was hiding. The cabin caught alight and Dorner died. Since his death the internet has been awash with the views of supporters. One supporter wrote on the Facebook pages: 'He killed CORRUPT cops, cops kill INNOCENT people!' On Twitter, @Rep_DanGordon wrote: 'Badges don't give cops special rights. This is what happens when a corrupt system pushes an honest man too far.' Another, going by the name gR1zZ_LBC wrote: 'I don't agree with what he did but I hope they never find him lol.' Some supporters claim Dorner was an honest man who was fighting corruption and racism . One man, called @becomeyoung wrote on the social networking site: 'Apparently burning people alive is now considered appropriate behavior for the police. Judge, jury and executioner.' Dorner died after the cabin caught fire during a shootout with police. One Facebook user wrote: 'Imagine burning someone alive and not even knowing for sure who it is.' BuzzFeed Radio host Jack Moore said the way the story unfolded made it even more attractive to supporters. He told CNN that the Dorner story 'resembles a Denzel Washington movie where someone is wronged, and he stands up for himself and goes down in a blaze of glory.' The drama has also exposed high levels of anger at police forces across the country. Dorner died during a police shootout and fire at the cabin in Big Bear, California, where he was hiding . One Dorner supporter wrote that anger levels are so high that more police will be killed. He said: 'It's about to get worse... police killings is about to rise believe it or not it gone happen. 'Police all work together... how do you win... if u say something and the police say something who you think they done believe sure as hell not us.' Civil rights attorney Connie Rice spoke on radio to say that some residents were 'lionizing and admiring Dorner.' She told CNN before the reforms - brought in after the LA riots that were sparked by the beating of Rodney King in 1991 - the relationship between the black community and police was a 'state of war'. However she said things had improved and said the black community could never 'condone this kind of violence.'\",\n",

A lightning strike on Saturday killed a man in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, a day after another strike killed a woman who had been out on a hike.

For the second day in a row, lightning killed a visitor at Rocky Mountain National Park in the Rockies of Colorado and injured the victims' companions . She died at the scene as rough weather allowed an air ambulance to land only between 'cycles of severe weather', Patterson said. The man killed in Saturday's incident was not identified. The victims were struck by lightning at Rainbow Curve, where visitors often gather to watch for rainbows after rainstorms. Patterson said rangers learned of the latest strike at the 11,000-foot high lookout trail shortly before 4 p.m. Mountain Time. Saturday's incident occurred shortly before 4 p.m., when rangers were notified of a lightning strike near Rainbow Curve, at 10,829 feet along Trail Ridge Road.

One of the most effective methods is to encourage beneficial insects, like ladybugs and lacewings, which naturally prey on common garden pests. You can do this by planting flowers and herbs that attract these beneficial bugs, such as marigolds, cosmos, and cilantro.\\n\\nAnother option is to use organic pest control sprays, like neem oil or insecticidal soap, which are derived from natural sources and are safe for the environment.

Civil engineer Nichola Smiles, 31, from Sugar Land, Texas weighed 180lbs and wore a size 14/16 before she made fitness her priority. After seeing how 'swollen' her face looked in photo in 2008, she knew she needed to make a change. Now Ms Smiles, who maintains a weight of 125lb, is a bodybuilding competitor, a fitness instructor, a personal trainer and a posing coach - in addition to her full-time job. Scroll down for video . Big goal: In 2008, Nichola Smiles wanted to lose 30lbs before going on a girls trip to Miami (left). After losing more than 50lbs, she is now she is a competitive bodybuilder (right) Fitness solution: After graduating from the University of Houston, Ms Smiles had gained 40lbs (left). Six years later, the 31-year-old maintains a weight of 125lbs (right) She has kept the pounds off for six years, noting that permanent weight loss is about\\xa0 'changing your relationship with food'. Ms Smiles explained: 'When you get to your final number, you're never done because the hardest part is maintaining.' When it comes to nutrition, she said: 'It's not about the taste. It's about the fuel.' But before she underwent a dramatic physical transformation, Ms Smiles was a young mom and a full-time student struggling with her weight. Ms Smiles, who gave birth to her son Joshua when she was 15-years-old, noticed that her metabolism started to change in college. Although she put on the 'freshman 15' as a student at the University of Houston, she didn't start rapidly gaining weight until after graduation. Courtesy Fitter Smiles . Physical training: The civil engineer started doing workout DVDs in her living room before she had the confidence to join a gym. She is currently a group fitness instructor, as well as a person trainer . Shocking realization: Ms Smiles said she knew she had to make a change after seeing this photo of herself at a friend's wedding in 2008 because she couldn't believe how 'swollen' her faced looked . As a civil engineer with disposable income, Ms Smiles found herself eating out more, traveling for business and indulging at after work happy hours.' 'I wasn't being conscientious of what I was putting in my body,' she said. Within six months Ms Smiles had put on 40lbs in addition to the weight she had gained in college. While she was aware that she was buying clothes in bigger sizes, she didn't have an 'aha moment' until she saw an unflattering photo of herself from a friend's wedding in 2008. 'I couldn't believe how swollen my face looked,' she recalled. Ms Smiles knew her weight was out of control, and it was in her living room that she gradually started to change the shape of her body. When she found herself watching an infomercial for one of Beachbody's many at home fitness programs, she got off of her couch and started doing the\\xa0exercises\\xa0from the commercial. Helping hand: Ms Smiles lost weight gradually (left), and when her weight loss plateaued, she hired a personal trainer to whip her into even better shape (right) New priorities: Ms Smiles often ate out and indulged in happy hours after college graduation (left). She now spends her spare time teaching fitness classes and working as a posing coach for other competitors (right) She later ordered the DVD series and worked out in her home until she felt comfortable enough to join 24 Hour Fitness, a local gym. Her first goal was to get down to 145lbs before going on a girls trip to Miami. But Ms Smiles's weight loss was gradual. It took her six months to lose 30lbs. 'It was more about inches at that time,' she said. 'I\\xa0didn't\\xa0want to be the fat friend at the beach.' Ms Smiles continued to challenge herself after her weight loss started to plateau. She soon made the decision to become a group fitness instructor. 'This entire a process has always been about working on myself,' she noted. After\\xa0maintaining\\xa0a weight of 130lbs for two years, Ms Smiles began working with personal trainer\\xa0Dewayne Malone. Mr Malone taught her how to balance calories as well as fat and carbohydrates. She lost 7lbs within a week of following his meal plan and training. The Houston trainer encouraged her to enter her first bodybuilding\\xa0competition\\xa0in 2012. Not only did Ms Smiles agree to compete, but she came in fourth place. Model teacher: Ms Smiles competed in her first fitness competition in 2012. While she continues to compete, she also helps other competitors with their stage presence . Striving for excellence: Ms Smiles (far right) started teaching group fitness classes at 24 Hour Fitness in order to continue to challenge herself . In 2013, Ms Smiles was 117lbs when she placed first in the open figure division at the Musclemania Superbody competition. While she has weighed as little as 104lbs, she noted it is a weight that is unrealistic for her to maintain. She instead chooses to stay at a healthy 125lbs throughout the year, so she is able to 'cheat' and go out to eat with her son and her friends. Before she starts training for a show, she explained that she indulges in a 'last supper', which is usually at\\xa0Perry's Steakhouse & Grille. She will then dedicate eight to 12 weeks to '100per cent clean eating' in order to prepare for the competition. Ms Smiles said that one common misconception is that people think they need to starve themselves to lose weight. Slow and steady: Ms Smiles (right) said the hardest part of reaching your goal weight is to maintain your weight loss. She said she has 'changed her relationship with food' and has kept the weight off for six years . Only human: The fitness competitor (right) allows herself to have cheat days when she is not training, so she is able to go out and eat with her family and friends . 'I eat six meals a day,' she said. 'I am always eating.' Because she has changed her relationship with food, she said she has no problem eating the same things over and over again. She quickly rattled off items from her weekly grocery list, which includes oatmeal, egg whites, grape fruit, salmon, tilapia, green beans, Greek yogurt, lean meat and sweet potatoes. And while she can happily eat a salad without dressing, she admitted that she is just like everyone else when it comes to cravings. 'I always try to be a fitness inspiration,' she said, 'but I want to tell people I like cookies like any other person. She added: 'But I know\\xa0that I can only have a certain amount of cookies... You\\xa0can have things if you learn how to balance.'\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'By . Neil Sears . Last updated at 1:45 AM on 3rd December 2011 . Nosebleeds are fairly common and caused when the tiny blood vessels inside the nose are disturbed. However, Mr Ford died hours after suffering one (posed by model) It was only a simple nosebleed – but within hours, it had killed gardener Robert Ford. Mr Ford, 47, was walking round the shops when his nose started to bleed, and promptly walked into a medical centre for help. The bleeding soon stopped, and doctors just told him to go home and put ice on his nose. Hours later, however, Mr Ford was found by his father, dead in his house. Spots of blood dotted his home – and more had blocked his airways. A pathologist said it was the only fatal nosebleed he had seen in 4,000 post mortems. Mr Ford’s grieving father Michael said after an inquest into his death: ‘We’re not looking to blame anyone, we’re just mystified at our son’s death. ‘He was a much loved son, brother and uncle.’ The tragedy developed as Mr Ford was walking through the town centre of Gravesend in Kent with his friend John Churchill. When his sudden nosebleed failed to . stop, he went to the Gravesend Medical Centre, where doctors were . clearly satisfied it was a routine problem which was likely to sort . itself out. But after he went home, the bleeding clearly started again – and he suddenly realised blood was beginning to clog his throat. Mr Ford senior told an inquest in . Gravesend, held on Wednesday, that he had phoned his son in June last . year, only to be told by Richard to dial 999 because he was unable to . breathe. Mystery: Mr Ford visited the Gravesend Medical Centre, who told him to put ice on his nose . Mr Ford said: ‘We found him dead on . the floor with a small pool of blood around his mouth. There were also . 10p-sized spots of blood around the house. ‘We rang the ambulance and paramedics . who tried to revive him. He was a very well-known character in . Gravesend and it’s a big loss for his family and friends.’ Pathologist Olaf Biedrzycki told the . inquest he had never seen a case like it in the 4,000 post-mortem . examinations he had carried out. Blood had entered Mr Ford’s airways, causing him to die, but Mr Biedrzycki could not explain where the blood came from. He said: ‘This was certainly an odd . case.

However, hours later, Ford was found dead by his father, Michael, with blood blocking his airways. Pathologist Olaf Biedrzycki, who conducted the post-mortem, stated that this was the only fatal nosebleed he had encountered in 4,000 examinations and could not determine the source of the blood.

              "  {'content': \"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Monday proposed listing the African lion as threatened after a study showed the big cats were in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future. A listing as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act would bar trafficking of the species as it faces dwindling habitat in Africa and more competition with humans. African lions, or Panthera leo leo, are found across a wide range in the continent, but about 70 percent, or 24,000, of them live in only 10 major strongholds, the service said in a statement. The\\xa0U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to list the African lion as a vulnerable species in order to stave off what it called the species' decline into extinction in the 'foreseeable future' Experts estimate there are around 35,000 lions left in the wild. In 1980, that number was closer to 80,000. One major problem lions face is the rapid\\xa0decimation\\xa0of their food animals to feed humans. As they lose prey, they turn to livestock. Humans in turn kill the lions that prey on their livestock. Listing lions as vulnerable would\\xa0bar trafficking of the species the US or by Americans. Listing the African lion as threatened 'will bring the full protections of U.S. law to lion conservation, allowing us to strengthen enforcement and monitoring of imports and international trade,' Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe said. The main threats to the African lion are loss of habitat and of the animals lions prey on, and increased conflict with humans, the statement said. People and farming and grazing activities have expanded into lion habitat and protected areas, putting more livestock near the big cats. As hunters reduce the number of animals that lions feed on, lions kill more livestock, leading to retaliatory killings by humans. The Fish and Wildlife Service is also proposing a rule that would set up permits for the importation of sport-hunted lion trophies. Sport-hunting is not seen as a threat to the species, the statement said. The Endangered Species Act bars such activities as import, export, commercial activity, interstate commerce and foreign commerce. It also heightens awareness of listed species and can provide financial aid to efforts to conserve them. The proposal to list the African lion as threatened follows a 2011 petition from a coalition of organizations. The Fish and Wildlife Service is seeking public comments for 90 days on its proposal.

The primary threats to the species include habitat loss, depletion of prey due to human activities, and increased conflict with humans, particularly over livestock. Listing the African lion as threatened would prohibit trafficking of the species and enhance enforcement and monitoring of imports and international trade.

              "  {'content': '\"Global declines in press freedom\" persisted last year, with setbacks highlighted in Israel, Italy, Taiwan, Hong Kong and elsewhere across the world, an annual survey said Friday. Media freedom campaigners don gags during a news conference in Hong Kong in April 2008. Freedom House, a nongovernmental organization that supports democracy and freedom of the media, said in its annual press freedom survey that \"negative trends\" outweighed \"positive movements in every region, particularly in the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and North Africa.\" \"This marked the seventh straight year of overall deterioration. Improvements in a small number of countries -- including bright spots in parts of South Asia and Africa -- were overshadowed by a continued, relentless assault on independent news media by a wide range of actions, in both authoritarian states and countries with very open media environments.\" Israel -- once the only country to be consistently rated free by the group in the Middle East and North Africa -- was ranked as \"partly free\" because of the Gaza conflict. The report cited \"increased travel restrictions on both Israeli and foreign reporters; official attempts to influence media coverage of the conflict within Israel; and greater self-censorship and biased reporting, particularly during the outbreak of open war in late December.\" Elsewhere in the Middle East, there are concerns about harassment of journalists and bloggers in Libya, Iran, Syria, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. The drop in violence in war-torn Iraq helped journalists move around the country, and a new law in the Kurdish region gave journalists \"unprecedented freedoms.\" Hong Kong, which is part of China, also dropped in rankings from free to partly free, a reflection of \"the growing influence of Beijing over media and free expression in the territory.\" \"Of particular concern were the appointment of 10 owners of Hong Kong media outlets to a mainland Chinese political advisory body, increased restrictions on film releases in the period surrounding the Olympics, and reports that critics of Beijing encountered growing difficulty in gaining access to Hong Kong media platforms.\" The report cited deterioration of of freedoms in Taiwan, which has been characterized as East Asia\\'s freest media environment. That\\'s because of \"legal pressures and attempts to control broadcast media outlets.\" Italy dropped from free to partly free because of the \"increased use of courts and libel laws to limit free speech, heightened physical and extralegal intimidation by both organized crime and far-right groups, and concerns over media ownership and influence,\" the report said. It cited fears about media magnate Silvio Berlusconi becoming prime minister again. There are concerns about \"the concentration of state-owned and private outlets under a single leader.\" In the former Soviet Union, \"legal pressure and attempts to control broadcast media outlets\" were cited in Russia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. The report noted other problems in Russia, saying \"reporters suffer from a high level of personal insecurity, and impunity for past murders or physical attacks against journalists is the norm.\" Across Africa, there were \"some improvements,\" citing developments in Comoros, Sierra Leone, Angola, and Liberia. But there were continued problems in places like Zimbabwe and Eritrea. \"Senegal took a significant step backward due to a dramatic increase in both legal and extralegal action against journalists and media houses, accompanied by overtly hostile rhetoric from the president and other officials,\" the report said. The report cited strides in South Asian nations, ranking the once \"not free\" Maldives to \"partly free.\" It mentioned a \"new constitution protecting freedom of expression, the opening of additional private radio and television stations, the release of a prominent journalist from life imprisonment, and a general loosening of restrictions after the country\\'s first democratic presidential election in October.\" It said Bangladesh and Pakistan reversed declines in freedom of the media. But there were setbacks in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, two countries racked by warfare. In some countries in the Americas, such as Mexico, Bolivia and Ecuador, \"attacks and official rhetoric against the media escalated.\" Venezuela and Cuba were ranked as not free, and there were \"high levels of intimidation and self-censorship\" in Colombia and Guatemala. Positive developments were noted in Guyana, Haiti and Uruguay. The worst-rated countries in the world are Myanmar, Cuba, Eritrea, Libya, North Korea and Turkmenistan. \"Given the current economic climate, which is certain to place a further strain on media sustainability and diversity in rich and poor countries alike, pressures on media freedom are now looming from all angles and are increasingly threatening the considerable gains of the past quarter-century,\" the report said.',\n",

Jean LaCroix, pictured, has been accused of having sex with a girl he was meant to be protecting . A social worker has been arrested during a major investigation into an alleged child foster care prostitution ring. Jean LaCroix, 46, who has been suspended as an investigator for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF), is accused of five counts of having sex with a vulnerable 17-year-old he was supposed to be protecting from abuse. LaCroix is the fifth man to be arrested as part of an ongoing probe into claims a ring of human traffickers was targeting and abusing neglected children in foster care in Miami. Four other men have been accused of using a child as a 'recruiter' to lure young vulnerable girls from the care system into becoming prostitutes. The 17-year-old is said to have told Miami-Dade Police . that she and the case worker had 'consensual sexual . intercourse on numerous occasions'. According to a search warrant obtained by CBS Miami, LaCroix would pick the alleged victim up from school and take her to his home where they . would have sex. The warrant also states the alleged victim was placed in the care of LaCroix for a month between September and October 2011, but phone records indicate that they had been engaged in a relationship for much longer - even after LaCroix was told to cut all contact by his supervisor. Secretary of DCF Secretary David Wilkins released a statement which said: 'This alleged behaviour is absolutely appalling and betrays the trust and confidence that all Floridians have in our Department's employees. 'Mr Lacroix's actions in no way reflect the expectations we and all Floridians have for our investigators or any of our employees.' LaCroix is also accused of trying to flee the country. He is alleged to have booked flights . to the Dominican Republic, but been turned back to the U.S. by customs . and arrested when he returned to New York on Saturday. Esther . Jacobo, DCF's regional supervisor, told\\xa0CBS Miami that the agency took . swift action, placing LaCroix on paid administrative leave, confiscating . his state-issued cell phone, and limiting his access to files and . children. Anturrell Nathaniel Dean, left, Willie Calvin Bivens, right, were charged with conspiracy, racketeering and unlawful sexual activity with a minor during the investigation into a foster care prostitution ring . Eric George Earle, left, David Zarifi, right, also face charges of conspiracy, racketeering and unlawful sexual activity with a minor . 'We did not fire him immediately in part because law enforcement asked us not to fire him immediately so that they could conduct appropriate investigations and prosecute the case.' Last week, police charged Eric George Earle, 29, called ‘E-Nasty,’ Willie Calvin Bivens, 65, called ‘Tank,’ Anturrell Nathaniel Dean, 30, and David Zarifi, 34, with conspiracy, racketeering and unlawful sexual activity with a minor. A fifth person - a 17-year-old foster child who is identified only by the initials S.S. - is listed in a 13-page sworn statement as a ‘recruiter’ for the ring, though she is not charged with any crimes. Using a teenage foster child as a recruiter, police say, the four men plied underage girls with cash, affection and gifts. The alleged pimps would then charge men $100 to have sex with the girls - who would be paid a fraction of that money.\",\n",

She is believed to have been targeted for her $1m life insurance policy . A father and son allegedly murdered a 72-year-old housekeeper to get their hands on a $1million insurance policy she didn't even know she had. Gerard Gorman, 48, and his son Bernard Gorman, 26, are accused of stalking Anita Fox for days in September before finding the time and place to kill her in Colleyville, Texas. It was the first homicide in the small town for more than 20 years. She was employed by the owners of the house, who were away at the time of the gruesome incident. Earlier this week, it was alleged the pair had been funneling $700 a month to maintain the policy, but it isn't known whether they knew their victim. The father was found dead in a Houston hotel room from natural causes last month. His son however was arrested in Florida on Wednesday. According to the Star-Telegram, the pair became suspects after police received a tip about a pickup truck they thought was suspicious. The younger Gorman was arrested on October 4 on an unrelated traffic charge. He told police he gave the truck to his father so he could drive to Oklahama, according to a police affidavit. He said he accidentally left his cellphone in the car. However, according to documents, they found a text message sent from Bernard Gorman's phone Sept. 21 that read, 'Sorry I can't talk me and him is in half murders.' Bernard Gorman told officers he used those words to describe an argument with his father. His story is believed to have unraveled when transmissions from a cell phone tower revealed he was in the area around the time of her death. According to the paper, officers also found internet searches for 'Anita Fox, Forth Worth' on the device. Three months later he was interviewed again and admitted he had lied during the first meeting. He then described how his father went inside the house and returned with blood on his arm. He then described how they drove to a gas station so they could then change his shirt. Suspects: Gerard Gorman, 48, (left) and his son Bernard Gorman, 26, are accused of stalking Anita Fox for days in September before finding the time and place to kill her . Police Chief Michael Holder told the Star-Telegram\\xa0: 'Their motive is greed.'We were able to get a license plate on the vehicle, and we were able to track the vehicle to the Houston area.\\xa0This is one of the most complex cases I have ever been involved in.

Southern California - particularly Los Angeles - is not ready for a major earthquake, which could devastate as many as 10 million people, an expert has warned. Speaking at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, Dr Lucy Jones said when the 'Big One' hits the southern part of state, the damage could be much worse and could endure for much longer than we've previously imagined. Dr Jones, an adviser for risk reduction at the U.S. Geological Survey, warned that electrical fibers and gas pipes cross the San Andreas fault line, while old water pipes would not withstand the impact. Warning: Dr Lucy Jones, speaking at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, warned that Los Angeles is not prepared for a massive earthquake due to its reliance on technology and old water pipes . The sort of earthquake she was referencing only hits once every 150 to 200 years, CBS Los Angeles warned, but it could leave southern California cut off from the rest of the country. In her lecture, entitled 'Imagine America without Los Angeles', she said that when a high-magnitude earthquake rocks . the San Andreas fault, the damage will be much worse than the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which saw collapsed buildings. Whereas that earthquake affected about a half a million people, today, a huge earthquake on the San Andreas fault could affect 10 million . Californians, she said. 'Loss of shelter, loss of schools, loss of jobs and emotional hardship. We are risking the ends of our cities,' she said. Her report pointed out that Los Angeles area supermarkets depend on Internet systems for warehousing and shipping food to stores - but that the food is on the other side of the fault line. Destruction: A freeway shows damage in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which affected half a million people. Experts said that a massive earthwuake would now affect up to 10 million people . Impact: Experts worry that a major earthquake along the San Andreas fault line sould cut off Los Angeles and much of Southern California from the rest of the country . 'With the development of the Internet and the new just-in-time economy, none of them store food on the Los Angeles side of the San Andreas anymore,' Jones said. 'So this is one more place where the development of the complexity of our modern society is creating new vulnerabilities as we face the big earthquakes.' Similarly, two thirds of the connectivity between L.A. and other cities travels through fiber-optic cables that cross the fault line, meaning that data capacity would be cut off. Damage to technology could put back the recovery effort months after the earthquake, she said. 'The World Wide Web wasn’t in existence at the time of the Northridge earthquake,' she said. 'Right now think of how much both your personal life, but also our economic system, depends on having cell phone communications and internet connectivity.' Cut off: The San Andreas fault line can be seen in relation to San Francisco. Experts said that our reliance on the internet and technology - which would be wiped out - could hinder recovery . Likewise, natural gas pipelines would also be hit, reducing heat and cooking capabilities. The USGS' 'Shakeout Report' predicts that it could take six months for the broken water pipes to be replaced across Southern California following a quake. In the Northridge Earthquake in January 1994, 57 people died and more than 8,700 were injured. Property damage was estimated to reach $20 billion, making it one of the most expensive in history. Its epicenter was the north-central San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. See below for video .\",\n",

Spain has pledged a repeat of its disgraceful block of Gibraltar and insisted it will continue to stop-check vehicles despite William Hague's intervention. The Foreign Secretary phoned his Spanish counterpart after Civil Guards caused eight-hour traffic jams by stopping every car and motorbike trying to leave the British territory. But his call for a speedy resolution to the border problems fell on deaf ears as Madrid bragged it would continue with its controversial policy. Civil Guards caused eight-hour traffic jams by stopping every car and motorbike trying to leave the British territory . Spanish Foreign Secretary Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo allowed diplomats to brief journalists they would continue to carry out 'exhaustive checks' whenever they deemed it necessary. Slapping Hague down less than 24 hours after their phone call, he claimed Spain was obliged to uphold the law. One Spanish Foreign Office official, sticking to the country's familiar strategy of making the Rock out to be a criminal haven, said: 'Spain has the obligation to make sure EU laws on the movement of people and tax are upheld to try to prevent things like tax evasion and to fight against smuggling.' The comments signalled Spain's determination to bolster their bid to make life uncomfortable for local Gibraltarians and the hundreds of British day-trippers who cross the border every day, even if their own people are caught up in the chaos. Spanish police stopped every one of 10,000 vehicles leaving Gibraltar. William Hague spoke to his Spanish counterpart yesterday . Officers from the Royal Gibraltar Police were forced to impose diversions and create beachside holding areas as Spanish authorities 'choked' the border, causing massive tailbacks in 30C heat . Civil Guards stopped every one of 10,000 vehicles leaving Gibraltar for Spain last Friday after Spanish fishermen sparked a standoff with the Royal Navy as they tried to disrupt the creation of an artificial reef in the Bay of Gibraltar. They caused one of the worst traffic jams in the Rock's history. Officers from the Royal Gibraltar Police were forced to impose diversions and create beachside holding areas in 30C heat. Foreign Secretary William Hague phoned his Spanish counterpart to discuss the issues with the British territory . The local health authority provided people with thousands of bottles of water as they wilted in the high temperatures. Gibraltar's Government later accused Spain of 'torture.' On Sunday, after creating two days of queues for people trying to get out of Spain, Civil Guards switched tactics and targeted vehicles going the other way. A Gibraltar-based librarian cycling into Spain was arrested for alleged assault on police in a detention condemned by the Rock's Chief Minister as brutal and barbaric. Tensions between Spain and Britain over Gibraltar have increased since PM Mariano Rajoy's right-wing government took power in November 2011. Spanish fishermen say the artificial reef they are fighting against, will affect their catches. In November last year the Royal Navy's HMS Scimitar was scrambled to intercept a Spanish warship called Vencedora when it entered Britain's territorial waters. Gibraltar-based delivery driver Dale Cherry, 32, was shot at by police last month as he took a friend out on a jet-ski. Civil Guard officers later claimed they were pursuing cigarette smugglers and insisted no shots were fired.\",\n",

Despite a campaign of turmoil, which saw David Moyes sacked as they struggled to adapt to life without Sir Alex Ferguson and finished seventh, United are behind only Real Madrid in the Deloitte's Football Money League. The Old Trafford outfit leapfrogged European superpowers Bayern Munich and Barcelona after their revenues rose from to £433.2m from £363.2m. Manchester United have moved up to second on the list despite not even being in the Champions League . Manchester United brought in more revenue for 2013-14 than any other club in the UK . Champions League winners Real Madrid are the wealthiest club in the world . Across town, Premier League champions Manchester City remain the second-richest English club, in sixth place globally behind Paris Saint Germain. League leaders Chelsea remain in seventh, ahead of Arsenal in eighth. Liverpool, no doubt buouyed by last season's ultimately unsuccessful title tilt, rise from 12th place to ninth overtaking Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan. United's rise is down to its rapid commercial growth, and with more deals announced this year they are expected to go from strength to strength despite the debt that remains from the 2005 Glazer takeover. In the 18th edition of the report, which uses figures sourced directly from each club and is put together by Manchester-based Deloitte’s Sports Business Group, City recorded the largest increase of any outfit in the top five - news Etihad bosses may see as a vindication of their methods. United broke the British transfer record to sign Angel di Maria from Real Madrid during the summer . They also spent £37m bringing Juan Mata to Manchester from Chelsea in January last year . Things weren't going well for David Moyes and United on the pitch but the opposite was true off it . The Premier League champions saw revenues rise from £271m to £346.5m a 28% increase. Thanks largely to the new broadcasting deals struck by the Premier League Newcastle United (19) and Everton (20) break into the top 20 for the first time. Spurs go up a place from 14th to 13th. In total English clubs make up five of the top 10 and eight of the top 20 – more than any other country. Dan Jones, partner at Deloitte’s Sports Business Group, said: “It was a very successful year for the North West clubs. No other region in the world has as many clubs in the top 20 and these clubs play a major role in the North West economy. 'Last year Premier League clubs benefitted from much larger broadcast revenues thanks to the latest round of deals. The Premier League is currently undertaking its next round of sales of broadcast rights and with the market expectation that another significant increase will occur, it is likely that the Money League will have a strongly English appearance in the coming years.' 1.

Brandishing two handguns in a California nightclub, this scantily-clad woman shows off her new acquisition - an official sheriff's badge proudly displayed on her cleavage. The image has caused uproar as the badge belongs to a Cudahy councilman at the centre of an FBI corruption probe who had been given the credentials by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Sheriff Lee Baca has now decided to recall some 200 badges his department has handed out to local politicians just two weeks after the picture was released by the U.S. attorney's office in support of bribery charges against three city officials. 'Vulgar display': This picture of a woman brandishing two guns while wearing an official sheriff's badge has re-ignited the debate about the abuse of credentials handed out to civilians with no law-enforcement roles . Abused: The badge, which is similar to the official ones worn by LA County law enforcement officials (left), had been given to Cudahy councilman Osvaldo Conde (right), who has been accused by the FBI of taking bribes . The sheriff's department has long . faced criticism for dishing out badges to civilians with no . law-enforcement duties because of fears it could lead to abuse. With the same six-pointed star design, . they are very similar to the ones worn by deputies, although they read . 'City Official Los Angeles County' instead of 'deputy sheriff'. The department said the badges were handed out so civilians can pass through sheriff command posts during emergencies, but some believe they are issued as rewards for political contributions. The gun-toting woman was pictured in . the El Potrero nightclub in Cudahy wearing the badge given to Councilman . Osvaldo Conde, one of three officials accused of taking a total of . $17,000 in bribes from the owner of a medical marijuana dispensary who . wanted to open a store in the city. Under pressure: LA County Sheriff Lee Baca (pictured) is now recalling some 200 badges given to politicians, but insists the timing of the move was not linked to the release of the picture of the gun-toting woman . The practice of giving out sheriff's badges to city officials has been around since 1986, according to an internal policy memo seen by the LA Times. Law enforcement officials say the credentials are issued so civilians can pass through sheriff command posts during emergencies. But critics claims it is more to do with rewarding political contributions. The policy was reviewed in 2010, but continued despite the attorney general's concerns that it could lead to abuse three years earlier. Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore insisted the timing of the recall was coincidence and had actually been prompted by a warning by the state attorney general in 2007. The AG's opinion was that the badges had to potential for civilians to falsely pose as police officers. But when questioned by the Los Angeles Times about why it had taken more than four years to take action, he replied: 'That's a good question.' Whitmore admitted the picture was a 'vulgar display', but said he was not aware of any other incident when a badge had been misused. The LA Times reports, however, that it had been a problem in the past. One of the most notable was the case of the 'Hillside Strangler' Kenneth Bianchi who had used a county emblem to pose as a police officer when luring his victims in the 1980s. One political contributor revealed previously how they used their honorary badge to gain access to a secure area of Bob Hope Airport in Burbank.\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'A Qatari man held for years in military custody in the United States was charged Friday in federal court with conspiracy \"to provide material support and resources\" to al Qaeda, prosecutors announced. Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was a student at Bradley University in Illinois when he was arrested in 2001. The Supreme Court was to hear arguments in April on a challenge by the suspect, Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, to the principle that the president has the authority to detain suspected terrorists indefinitely and without charges. The Justice Department on Friday asked the high court to dismiss that pending appeal. \"Because the military detention challenged by the petitioner has ended, no live controversy remains in this case,\" said Obama administration lawyers in their brief. Al-Marri\\'s lawyers oppose such a move, saying the fundamental constitutional question of military detentions needs to be answered. The federal indictment means the case will be transferred to civilian courts for prosecution. Andy Savage, one of al-Marri\\'s lawyers, visited him at the naval brig in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday to show him the indictment charging him with terrorism. \"He denies it,\" Savage said. \"I\\'m sure he\\'ll enter a not guilty plea.\" Savage said he was disappointed in the information contained in what he called a brief indictment. \"We\\'d like information about what he\\'s supposed to have done,\" he said. \"You\\'d think after 7½ years they\\'d have a little more to say. \"The most important thing to him is he now has some definition of his future. Before, he didn\\'t know if he\\'d be charged, be repatriated or held forever.\" The decision by the Obama administration to criminally charge al-Marri after he spent seven years in custody -- more than five years in South Carolina -- is the latest twist in the ongoing legal saga of the only remaining \"enemy combatant\" held in the United States. He had been accused of being an al Qaeda sleeper agent, but until this indictment he had never been charged with a criminal or terrorism-related offense. He will be transferred at some point to Peoria, Illinois, to face a criminal trial. Oral arguments in the case are scheduled April 27. A Justice Department official said the White House will release an official presidential order to transfer al-Marri into civilian custody. Al-Marri\\'s lawyer applauded the move. \"This indictment is an important step toward restoring the rule of law and is exactly what should happen when the government suspects an individual of terrorist acts. This case is now finally where it belongs: in a legitimate court that can fairly determine whether Mr. al-Marri is guilty of a crime,\" said Jonathan Hafetz, an ACLU attorney who is representing him in the pending high court appeal. President Obama last month ordered a prompt and thorough review of the \"factual and legal basis\" for the continued detention of al-Marri. Obama late Friday issued a presidential memorandum ordering Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to facilitate al-Marri\\'s transfer, calling it \"in the interest of the United States.\" Since his initial arrest on credit card fraud charges in December 2001, al-Marri, a 43-year-old legal resident of the United States, has remained in \"virtual isolation in the brig,\" his attorneys said. They were suing the government to improve his jail conditions and are challenging the constitutionality of his detention. They said his cell at the brig in South Carolina is only 9 feet by 6 feet and he is allowed little contact with the outside world, including his family. Military officials deny mistreatment. The case posed a sticky legal dilemma for the high court and the current and previous administrations. President George W. Bush ordered al-Marri confined in military custody, and the Bush Justice Department had been filing the appeals opposing al-Marri\\'s legal claims. At issue was whether the Authorization for Use of Military Force, passed by Congress after the September 11, 2001, attacks, gave the president the power to order the indefinite military detention of an accused terrorist seized on domestic soil. Al-Marri arrived in the United States the day before the 2001 terrorist attacks as a computer science graduate student at Bradley University in Peoria. He had earned an undergraduate degree there a decade earlier. Weeks later, he was arrested after authorities found hundreds of credit card numbers belonging to others in his home. At an early court hearing, a prosecutor said al-Marri was believed to be an associate of al Qaeda, the Islamic terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The case against al-Marri escalated when investigators further examined his computer and interrogated al Qaeda detainees, the government said. Although al-Marri was not charged with terrorism-related offenses, Bush in June 2003 issued a formal declaration naming him an \"enemy combatant\" and transferring him to military custody. That move sent him out of the normal criminal justice system into indefinite military detention. The declaration alleges al-Marri engaged in \"hostile and warlike acts\" working as an \"al Qaeda sleeper agent\" who was planning to \"hack into the computer systems of U.S banks,\" for a possible follow-up to the 9/11 attacks. The Pentagon said he had trained at a terror camp in Afghanistan, met al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and \"volunteered for a martyr mission,\" according to the government\\'s filing with the high court. A lawyer for Jose Padilla, an American citizen detained as an enemy combatant, said the government\\'s actions in the al-Marri case echo those in Padilla\\'s, in which he says criminal charges were filed shortly before the case was to go to the Supreme Court. \"This is deja vu all over again -- what the Bush administration did with Padilla, the Obama administration is trying to do with al-Marri,\" he said. \"Transferring al-Marri out of the brig is the right thing to do. Moving to dismiss the case is not.\" The case is U.S. v. al-Marri (09-CR-10030). CNN\\'s Carol Cratty and Pam Benson contributed to this report.',\n",

Paul Duffy, who has a tattoo of serial killer Herman Webster Mudgett on his leg, has collected ‘murderabilia’ for years and since last month has also been profiting from his hobby by selling off some of his prized collection. Some people are disgusted at the idea of profiting from others misfortune, but Duffy sees little wrong with his entrepreneurial efforts. Paul Duffy has turned has macabre fascination with serial killers into an online business which some people want shut down . Duffy, 23, promotes his goods via a Facebook page called ‘Wholesale Murder.’ He says there is a lot of interest in 'murderabilia' because its taboo and morbid. 'There’s a big underground market for it,' he told CBS Philly. He says he has already sold killers’ artwork, letters and even hair, blood and fingernail clippings. Items currently for sale include a prison-ID card that belonged to cult killer Charles Manson, pornographic pencil drawings by 80′s Philadelphia sex strangler Harrison Marty Graham and a bag of blood belonging to Japanese cannibal killer Issei Sagawa. A prison ID card that once belonged to cult killer Charles Manson and documents featuring his signature are amongst the item that Paul Duffy is selling . Duffy shows hair belonging to various serial killers, while the drawing of a bear is by murder Bobby Ray Gilbert . However efforts are underway to have the Facebook site shut down by people who don’t believe he or anyone else should profit from other’s tragedy. ‘Collect all you want, but where I draw the line is when you’re selling items that were obtained from serial killers and high-profile killers for profit,’ Andy Kahan told The Reporter. Kahan, a victim advocate in Houston, Texas has crusaded against 'murderabilia' sales since he first learned of them in 1999. ‘People who sell these items profit from the pain, misery and grief that (murder) victims suffered and give the killers an infamy and immortality they do not deserve,’ he said. Duffy says he doesn't mean to hurt anyone. 'We are not throwing it in people’s faces. I sincerely care about these prisoners. They’re still people,' he said.

As Davis notes, \"He did not have prejudices against gay people.\" Davis gives just a few of many examples. But she then goes where I don\\'t think we should. She states of her father and same-sex marriage: \"I don\\'t think he would stand in the way of it, at all. I don\\'t think he would stand in the way of two people wanting to make a commitment to one another.\" French lawmakers approve same-sex marriage bill . Davis then uses an argument that is libertarian (which Reagan was not), and which fails to understand the essence of conservatives\\' objection to same-sex marriage: \"I also think because he wanted government out of peoples\\' lives, he would not understand the intrusion of government banning such a thing. This is not what he would have thought government should be doing.\" The problem with that statement, applied to the same-sex marriage debate, is this: Conservatives object to the federal government rendering unto itself the unprecedented ability to redefine marriage. Such is a massive step toward government intervention (one that should worry libertarians), toward powerful government, toward big government -- not restrained and limited government. It is a step that breaks entirely new ground in not only American history but human history, one with unimaginable and extraordinary effects yet to come on the family, the culture, the economy, government services and (among others) the court system. The essence of conservatism is to preserve and conserve time-tested values that have endured for good reason and for the best of society and for order. Conservatives -- which is what Reagan was -- aim to conserve. By their nature and definition, conservatives do not rush into radical changes or what they fear may be another fad or fashion or popular demand. They also, by their definition, ground their ideals in both natural law and biblical law. I know that secular liberals don\\'t want to hear religious arguments against same-sex marriage, but, if we\\'re talking about Reagan (and conservatives), we cannot exclude them. Sutter: Same-sex marriage hasn\\'t won (yet ...) Contrary to the image of him as president, Reagan was very religious and would not have so easily consented to a culture suddenly demanding the right to redefine what the scriptures (Old Testament and New Testament) say clearly about a man and a woman leaving their parents and coming together to form one flesh in marriage. Reagan\\'s religious roots were deep, inculcated by his mother, an extremely devout, traditional Christian, and others who profoundly influenced him in Dixon, Illinois, in the 1920s. He said that \"everything\" he learned about the values that shaped his life and presidency he learned back in Dixon. It was his \"inheritance,\" one that never left him. Needless to say, Reagan did not learn to support same-sex marriage in Dixon. Moreover, Reagan was unwavering in his conviction of the importance of a father and a mother raising children and the next generation of American citizens and understood marriage as a vital bond between a man and a woman. To cite just one example from the final days of his presidency (January 12, 1989), Reagan insisted that \"we must teach youngsters the beauty of the loving, lifelong relationship between husband and wife that is marriage.\" Yes, Reagan was tolerant of gay people -- as is everyone I know who opposes same-sex marriage -- but that in no way means he would have advocated redefining marriage. Toleration of something certainly does not automatically translate into advocating its legalization. We could list innumerable things that we tolerate -- including from friends and family and loved ones -- but wouldn\\'t argue legalizing. Even then, that\\'s not quite the issue. The issue, after all, isn\\'t whether homosexuality should be legal (no one objects to that) but whether marriage will now begin a long process of continual redefinition. It\\'s a form of intellectual laziness for liberals/progressives to reflexively assume that anyone who disagrees with them on redefining marriage is a recalcitrant bigot with no possible legitimate reasons. After all, same-sex marriage opponents are adhering to the prevailing definition of marriage according to its literal and ancient roots; they believe in the cross-cultural norm that humanity has adhered to since the dawn of humanity, to a human understanding as old as the Garden of Eden. It\\'s remarkably short-sighted to dismiss them as hopeless bigots. That brings me back to Ronald Reagan. It\\'s funny, people on the political left spent eight years calling Reagan a bigot. When liberals weren\\'t denouncing him as an unregenerate racist -- the single most unfair charge unceasingly flung at Reagan -- they were saying that he didn\\'t like gay people and did nothing about AIDS because he was happy to let gays die. Davis remembers this well, as she does the vicious accusation that her father was a nuclear warmonger. To say that liberals were unhinged in their nastiness to Reagan is insufficient. Now, in his death, they\\'d like to remold him in their own image, crowning him a poster boy for same-sex marriage. The simple truth is that Reagan was a committed and principled conservative who had thoughtful and firmly grounded reasons for his positions. That, too, ironically, is a fact that liberals ignored, caricaturing Reagan as an idiot, a simpleton, an \"amiable dunce,\" as Clark Clifford famously called him. He would not have merrily hopped on the same-sex marriage bandwagon without first carefully considering how the issue fit with his understanding of the laws of nature and nature\\'s God, of the first things and first principles that conservatives of Reagan\\'s generation spent years discussing at great length in their books and publications and conferences. Could we at least agree on this much? Reagan was silent on same-sex marriage, as was everyone of his generation. He, like all liberals of his time, could not have conceived of same-sex marriage, and he, like the entirety of the Democratic Party just a decade or two ago, unwaveringly supported traditional marriage. Let\\'s leave it at that.',\n",

              "  {'content': \"Patti Davis, Ronald Reagan's daughter, argues that her father would not have opposed same-sex marriage, citing his lack of prejudice and his belief in limited government. However, the author of this piece contends that this view misinterprets Reagan's conservative principles. Reagan, deeply influenced by his religious upbringing and traditional values, would likely have opposed redefining marriage. The author emphasizes that conservatives, including Reagan, aim to preserve time-tested values and are wary of radical changes. Reagan's religious roots, shaped by his mother and the community in Dixon, Illinois, instilled in him a strong belief in the traditional definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The author also notes that Reagan's tolerance of gay people does not equate to support for same-sex marriage, and that conservatives have legitimate reasons for opposing it, grounded in both natural and biblical law. The piece concludes by highlighting the unfairness of liberals who, during Reagan's presidency, often labeled him as a bigot and now seek to portray him as a supporter of same-sex marriage, despite his commitment to conservative principles.\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"By . Laura Williamson . Another year, another Arsenal captain bidding farewell to north London. Thomas Vermaelen became the fifth current skipper to leave the club in the past nine years when he joined Barcelona, following Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry, Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie's departures. With new captain Mikel Arteta already into the last year of his contract, it does not bode well for the Spaniard's chances of staying at the Emirates beyond next summer. Arsene Wenger's willingness to sell his skippers - assets that should, traditionally, be at the very heart of any football club - betrays the Frenchman's lack of sentimentality, but also the lack of regard in which the Arsenal manager holds the position. Fresh start: Former Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen is presented as Barcelona's latest summer signing . Sold: Both Vermaelen (left) and Patrick Vieira (right) were let go by Arsene Wenger . He did not strip Vermaelen of the club captaincy last season although the Belgian made only 21 appearances, initially owing to a stress fracture in his back, while he seemed to think it insignificant that another player, usually Arteta, would wear the armband on the pitch in the defender's absence. Questions about captaincy generally merit one of Wenger's quizzical looks, as he ponders why people brought up on Bobby Moore, John McGovern or Bryan Robson are making such a fuss about an armband on a shirt sleeve. But it does matter. Old-fashioned though it may seem, you want there to be honour in an individual being chosen to be the captain of your football club. At Arsenal, however, the role has been diminished to the point where it was fitting the club ended their trophy drought by winning the FA Cup at Wembley last May with their long-term captain, Vermaelen, as an unused substitute. It is not just at Arsenal, of course, but across English football at many football clubs. The England captain's armband has long been devalued; tossed haphazardly between one-cap wonders during dismally dull friendlies or given, sentimentally, to players who have reached a milestone number of appearances for their country. This is very sweet, but it shows that, contrary to what we might like to believe, the captain's armband is ultimately just a piece of cloth tied around a player's shirt sleeve. Gone: Robin van Persie wore Arsenal's captain's armband before leaving for Manchester United . Leaving London: Thierry Henry (left) and Van Persie (right) decided to leave the Emirates for new challenges . There are no special privileges for a football captain in the Laws of the Game, after all, merely an expectation that they work with the referee and take responsibility for their team's behaviour. Players look to their manager or coaches on the sidelines for tactical direction, unlike on a cricket pitch, and so a football captain's role is largely ceremonial or inspirational. You would hope it still means something, though, otherwise what's the point of having a captain at all? They meet the referee with the team-sheet an hour before kick-off, and should act as a pathway between players and management and, ideally, between the club and its fans. This may be as simple as the ghosted, largely anodyne notes that appear every fortnight in the matchday programme under the captain's name, or fronting up to the television cameras or written press when things are not going so well. It could also be things that help make team-mates' lives easier: Joey Barton recalls requesting six new plugs for the players' baths when he was made captain at QPR, to save them trying to clog up the holes with toilet paper. Captain fantastic: Cesc Fabregas lead the Gunners before swapping north London for Barcelona in 2011 . These varied roles, however, make it a particularly difficult task if the club captain is not a guaranteed starter. How can he act as a go-between if he is worried about his place in the squad or not on the pitch at all? This concern now affects a manager's choice of captain more than, perhaps, their suitability as a leader. Some Arsenal fans, for instance, have suggested Aaron Ramsey or Jack Wilshere should have been chosen this time around, but their relative youth has prompted Wenger to look elsewhere. By picking talismanic players such as Henry, Fabregas and Van Persie to wear the armband in the past, the captaincy became something the Arsenal boss did not really have to think about. His captain led the team out, invariably scored or put in a match-winning performance, and that was that. When Wenger abandoned this model, with William Gallas and then Vermaelen, the captaincy suddenly became an issue again; an issue Wenger does not want or particularly recognise as important in the grand scheme of running a football club. Consequently, it is not since Patrick Vieira in 2005 that Arsenal have had a captain who really seemed to define the honour, in the traditional sense of how we want our captains to be. Sadly, that has been sold off a long time ago. VIDEO Excited Vermaelen relishing Barca challenge .\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"Arsenal's frequent changes in team captains over the past nine years, with Thomas Vermaelen being the latest to leave for Barcelona, highlight a trend of diminishing the role's significance under manager Arsene Wenger. Vermaelen, along with previous captains Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry, Cesc Fabregas, and Robin van Persie, all departed the club, often during their tenure as captain. Wenger's willingness to sell these key players and his apparent lack of sentimentality towards the captaincy have raised questions about the role's importance at the club. The current captain, Mikel Arteta, is also in the last year of his contract, suggesting a similar fate might await him. This pattern reflects a broader trend in English football where the captain's role is often seen as more ceremonial than substantive, with the armband sometimes given to players for milestone appearances or during friendlies. Despite this, the captaincy should still carry honor and responsibility, acting as a bridge between players, management, and fans. However, at Arsenal, the role has been reduced to the point where it no longer holds the traditional weight and significance.\",\n",

A woman desperate to lose weight has swallowed a gastric balloon, which works by expanding in her stomach to curb appetite. Lucy Heather from Berkshire says she piled on the pounds after having her two children and was miserable at four stone overweight. After managing to lose a stone and a half on her own she plateaued - and sought the assistance of a Â£3,000 surgery-free gastric balloon, she revealed to Lorraine on the sofa this morning on ITV. Scroll down for video . The Obalon balloon is swallowed as a pill and expands in the stomach to make you feel full . 'I felt it for the first couple of days but now can't,' says Lucy, who has had the balloon in her stomach for two weeks and is eating smaller portions because of it. The balloon can be swallowed in a capsule and expands once inside the stomach. It works by floating on top of the . stomach, stopping you eating quite as much and stimulating the receptors which tell you you're full, sooner. As the device is so new, doctors are as yet unaware of any long-term side effects - though in the short term, Lucy says, the balloon is relatively low risk, and removal through a simple endoscopy is reportedly fast and painless. Critics such as nutritionist Amanda Ursell, who joined her on the sofa, say the balloon will not change your eating habits in the long term. 'Its not a magic bullet,' she says. 'It is absolutely crucial that people realise this. You must invest commitment to weight loss. Amanda Ursell (left), Lucy Heather (middle) and Lorraine (right) discuss the balloon, it works by expanding in the stomach and stimulating the receptors that tell you you're full . 'When i see someone who really wants . to lose weight, they do it regardless of whatever they've been doing . before and just focus on losing weight. This is not a quick fix. 'If you are going to do it you have to embrace that you are going to have to change your eating habits afterwards. You have to make the commitment to change your eating habits long term and your lifestyle.' Lucy says she is getting nutritional advice and exercising, and Lorraine will follow her progress and have her back on the show in a few months. 'I haven't noticed any significant side effects, no nausea or anything like that,' says Lucy. Lorraine will have Lucy back on the show in a few months to monitor her progress . Last . month the Mail reported that, unlike other gastric balloon treatments, . the new device, called Obalon, does not require invasive surgery. Instead, in a 10-minute procedure,  patients simply swallow a capsule the size . of a large vitamin pill which contains a deflated balloon. The . capsule is attached to a hollow tube and, once the capsule arrives in . the stomach, the balloon is inflated to the size of an apple. The . capsule dissolves and the tube is removed via the mouth. Patients . receive a second balloon 30 days after the first procedure, with the . option of a third balloon after around 60 days, based on their weight . loss and feelings of fullness. At the end of the treatment plan, a few months later, the balloons are deflated and removed during an outpatient procedure. Patients . are not able to retain the balloons for more than 90 days but the hope . is that the treatment will help them make lifestyle changes which they . will then be able to maintain once the balloons have been removed. Obalon costs from Â£2,995 for a two-balloon treatment. It is currently only available privately. It is aimed at people who are not sufficiently overweight to qualify for weight-loss surgery. Clinical trials in the UK and in the U.S. have shown that patients lose an average of 1st 3lbs in 12 weeks.\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'On a visit to Japan on Tuesday, Vice President Joe Biden assured his hosts that the United States will express concerns to China over Beijing\\'s recent claim of a large swath of airspace in the region. The Chinese declaration less than two weeks ago has prompted a war of words between governments and flights through the contested air zone by military planes from the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. \"We, the United States, are deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea,\" Biden said at a news conference alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Asia trip gives Biden chance to show off diplomatic cred . \"I will be raising these concerns with great specificity directly when I meet with the Chinese leadership\" on a later leg of his trip, Biden said. The uneasy situation in the sky over the East China Sea has raised fears that a midair incident could cause circumstances to spiral out of control. It has also fueled concern about how far China is willing to go to pursue its interests in the Asia-Pacific region and push back against U.S. influence. \"The United States has an interest in the lowering of tensions in this vital region, as I believe all the countries in northeast Asia share that same interest with us,\" Biden said. China is asking aircraft entering its air defense zone to identify themselves and submit flight plans. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki reiterated Monday that Washington recognizes neither the air defense zone nor China\\'s demand to be notified of plans by jets from other nations to fly into the area. Japan has told its airlines not to comply with the new Chinese demands, but the U.S. government has urged American carriers to follow Beijing\\'s instructions. The Chinese action, Biden said, raises the possibility of \"accidents and miscalculation.\" Biden promises to press China on airspace dispute . He praised the alliance between the United States and Japan, sayings the U.S. commitment to Japan is critical. He called Japan the cornerstone of stability in the region. Tokyo and Beijing\\'s bitter dispute over a set of small, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea has already led to frequent tense encounters between the two sides\\' ships and planes over the past year. Now, China\\'s new air defense zone overlaps significantly with that of Japan and encompasses the disputed islands and the natural resources around them. \"We meet in a moment, Prime Minister, when a new Asia Pacific is emerging, with limitless potential, but also new dynamics, rising tensions and the risk of miscalculation,\" Biden said. Geng Yansheng, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, defended China\\'s actions in a written statement. China\\'s airspace claim, he said, \"is a zone of safety, not risks, a zone of cooperation, not competition.\" China\\'s air defense zone: What you need to know . China\\'s actions are justified by what it sees as aggressive moves by the Japanese to lay claim to the disputed territory. \"Japan\\'s actions have seriously harmed China\\'s legitimate rights and security interests, and undermined the peace and stability in East Asia,\" Geng said. Without naming the United States, Geng warned third countries about becoming involved in the dispute. \"Other parties concerned should also mind their words and actions, and should not do things to undermine regional stability and bilateral relations,\" he said. \"Other parties should not be incited, or send wrong signals to make a very few countries go further on the wrong track, which will follow the same old disastrous road and undermine regional and world peace.\" In addition to the China airspace claim, Biden and Abe discussed ways to fortify U.S.-Japan relations economically and militarily.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'Two Russian bombers have landed at a Venezuelan airfield where they will carry out training flights for several days, the Russian defense ministry said Wednesday. Russia\\'s Tupolev TU-160, pictured here in 2003, is a long-range strategic bomber. The Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers landed at Venezuela\\'s Libertador military airfield and \"will spend several days carrying out training flights over neutral waters, after which they will return to the base,\" the ministry added. NATO fighters followed the bombers on their 13-hour flight over the Arctic Ocean and the Atlantic, the defense ministry said. It said the Russian flights were carried out in strict accordance with international rules governing airspace above neutral waters, and that the aircraft did not violate the borders of other states. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said such joint exercises between nations are not unusual. \"We exercise all around the globe and have joint exercises with countries all over the world. So do many other nations.\" The U.S. will monitor the Russian-Venezuelan training, said Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified as they are not authorized to speak on the information. On Monday, Russia announced it might hold joint naval maneuvers with Venezuela in the Caribbean. The declaration came amid increased tension between Russia and the United States over Russia\\'s invasion last month of the former Soviet republic of Georgia, a U.S. ally that aspires to join NATO. On Monday Russia denied any link between that announcement and the conflict in Georgia, although Russia has criticized U.S. support for Georgia. Russia has also objected to the missile defense system agreement, signed between the United States and Poland and the Czech Republic in August, that places a ground-based ballistic defense facility in the two eastern European nations. Russia has said the deal threatens its security, while the United States has said that the system is to guard against rogue states such as Iran. Earlier this month, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, whose comments have frequently antagonized Washington, said it would welcome the Russian air force, according to Russian news agency Novosti. \"If Russian long-range bombers should need to land in Venezuela, we would not object to that either. We will also welcome them,\" Chavez said on September 1, according to Novosti. CNN\\'s Mike Mount contributed to this story .',\n",

Blatter’s aides are claiming only six people have seen the full 430-page findings. They are ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert and his deputy Alan Sullivan, investigator Garcia and his No 2 Cornel Borbely, plus Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber and Domenico Scala, FIFA’s compliance chief. However, such is Blatter’s control of world football’s ruling body that plenty of scepticism surrounds everything said on his behalf — especially when Garcia’s evidence of any wrongdoing during those murky 2018 and 2022 campaigns is of such importance to FIFA. Sepp Blatter insists that he hasn't seen the Michael Garcia report into World Cup bidding corruption . The 127th International Olympic Committee session taking place in Monaco this week . But Blatter — asked face to face by Sports Agenda during a break in the Congress to confirm what his Zurich advisors insisted was true — was adamant he had not been shown Garcia’s work. Blatter said: ‘I can confirm 100 per cent I have not seen the Garcia report. As I have said all along, the two ethics chambers act independently from FIFA.’ The FIFA farce continues with Zurich’s appeals committee due to hear Garcia’s complaint this week after he disowned Eckert’s summary conclusions as ‘materially incomplete’ and an ‘erroneous representations of the facts’. BT Sport have bizarrely followed arch-rivals Sky in naming dressage champion Charlotte Dujardin  as their sportswoman of the year, despite the more obvious claims of Olympic skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold and Jo Pavey, who won the European Championship 10,000 metres aged 40. The BBC’s far more relevant Sports Personality vote will have the last say on Sunday about who is the top British sportswoman of 2014. Charlotte Dujardin (centre) is presented with the BT sportswoman of the year award . Lizzy Yarnold won gold on the skeleton at the Winter Olympics in Sochi in February . Jo Pavey won the 10,000m at the European Championship in August aged 40 . The ECB have named Russell Evans and Paul Baldwin as new first-class umpires for 2015 despite an upcoming ageism employment case. Peter Willey and George Sharp have a tribunal date in February to contest being retired from the umpires roster against their wishes when in good health at the age of 65. The ECB say they took legal advice before publishing the umpire roster ahead of the tribunal. ............................................................................. West Bromwich Albion, who are joining Crystal Palace at a Premier League football festival in Mumbai this week to tap into the burgeoning Indian football market, are taking a lifesize silicon model of goalkeeper Ben Foster with them for promotional purposes. Neville’s decision time . The FA and Sky remain remarkably relaxed about Gary Neville combining his coaching and pundit roles — despite his Dog & Duck v Red Lion comments about Manchester United and Liverpool this week once again highlighting the conflict around England players. Neville is aware of the potential dangers, saying in his newspaper column: ‘I accept I am having my cake and eating it, with broadcasting and the England coaching role. 'That will end. I know the decision is looming. I committed to Sky for four years and Roy Hodgson for four years and I’m not stupid enough to think I will combine those functions for ever.’ The most likely outcome is that Neville tries his hand as a club manager after Euro 2016. Gary Neville said Manchester United's match against Liverpool on Sunday will be like a pub game . Neville (left) is still juggling his roles England coaching role with his media work at Sky Sports . There is considerable concern within grass-roots sport that the fall-out from Sport England’s botched Active People Survey will significantly affect budget plans for the financial year starting in April. Sports have been told by SE that the delay until January in receiving the amended APS figures, which are central to funding decisions, means the money handed out will not be announced until March 18, giving less than two weeks to put budgets in place. One chairman described the situation as a ‘complete shambles’. Channel 4 insist there is no connection between the fact that their IMG-produced horseracing coverage has been so widely criticised, and Sunset & Vine alone winning the TV production tender for the Rio Paralympics when they did the London Paralympics in partnership with IMG.

Photos taken from the country's east show the heavily armed Chadian soldiers standing before destroyed vehicles and mangled corpses of the Islamist militants. But in a brutal reprisal, Boko Haram fighters have raided more than a dozen villages near the border with Cameroon, where scores of militants shot and hacked residents to death.

Chadian soldiers, armed to the teeth with guns and explosives, stop to rest during their offensive against Boko Haram . Hundreds of residents fled across the border into Cameroon, prompting Chad - part of a regional coalition against the Islamists - to respond by bombarding rebel positions. 'They targeted  mainly Shuwa tribesmen, who are from the same ethnic group as a large number of the Chadian troops,' said Adum Walfannea, himself a Shuwa Arab, from Anguduram village. Kurso Khala, who fled one of the worst-affected villages, Mudu, said the militants besieged a local market and blocked all but one entrance. 'They would ask if a person is Kanuri or Shuwa before asking him to go,' said Khala by telephone from Fotokol, across the border from the Nigerian town of Gamboru in the far north of Cameroon. 'Once a person was identified as Shuwa\\u200e he would be shot in the back as soon as he stepped out of the market entrance to leave.' Walfannea and Imar Koshnana, from Musiye village, both said the death toll from the attacks could be high but there was no official confirmation of numbers.

News of the raids comes as Nigeria's military trumpets its success in recapturing several towns from Boko Haram and after President Goodluck Jonathan said the 'tide had turned' against the militants. Details were slow to emerge because the insurgents have destroyed telecom masts since the insurgency began in 2009. The attacks follow the Chadian ground and aerial offensive against Boko Haram enclaves  that began on February 17 after troops seized the strategic town of Dikwa. Residents said Boko Haram suffered heavy casualties in the Chadian attacks, which were near the group's Sambisa Forest stronghold, where they have long had camps. One resident from the herding village of Gonori near Gamboru, Umar Sanda, said troops fought back after Boko Haram stole more than 400 cattle and killed four residents in a pre-dawn raid on Tuesday. 'For more than two hours we kept hearing sounds of gunfire and explosions,' he added. 'The Chadian troops killed scores of the Boko Haram gunmen and recovered our cattle.'

Meanwhile, Nigeria's army chief said that residents displaced from Baga town in the country's northeast should be able to return to vote in March elections after the military reclaimed the town. Lieutenant General Kenneth Minima spoke to journalists Wednesday in Maiduguri after he said he visited the town on Lake Chad in northeastern Nigeria, near the borders of Chad, Niger and Cameroon. Minima said that Nigeria's army would take back more towns from the Islamic extremists. 'From today it is never again for insurgents to take hold of any of our territory. I told them that today it is going to be victory all the way because the war is almost ended. From here we move to retake Gwoza, Marte and Madagali,' he said. He said he was confident that it was 'achievable to end the Boko Haram activities very soon,' and that residents who have been displaced should be able to return to their homes for March 28 presidential elections.

Neighboring countries increasingly have been drawn into Nigeria's 5-year Islamic uprising, which has killed thousands and driven 1.6 million people from their homes, including across borders into Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Boko Haram has been recruiting fighters in all three countries. Cameroon officials said that its prisons, especially at its border with Nigeria, are overcrowded with suspected Boko Haram members. Maroua Central Prison registrar Ngeh Emmanuel said that 30,000 people have been detained in 25 prisons in Cameroon since May 2014, up from 22,000 detained before that. More soldiers are needed to stop inmates from endless attempts to break out of jail, he said. A Chad army vehicle passes through Nigeria before launching an offensive against Boko Haram .

Supporters of former president and current candidate Malam Sanha rally in Bissau. The race is between two former heads of state, Kumba Yala and Malam Sanha. The candidates won the most votes in the first round of balloting June 28. Analysts hope the new president will usher in an era of stability to the nation of 1.5 million. The former Portuguese colony has had a history of military coups since its independence in 1974. President Joao Bernardo Vieira became president in 1980 after a military coup. He was accused of purging political rivals and suppressing dissent, but several coup attempts in the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him. He was finally ousted in 1999 -- and re-elected in 2005. Vieira was killed in March to reportedly avenge the death of the country\\'s military chief a day earlier. Yala, who took office in 2000, was unseated in a military coup after three years. Sanha served as interim president for a few months before his opponent\\'s term. The conflicts have ravaged the nation\\'s infrastructure and economy, leaving it among the poorest in the world. Guinea-Bissau has been battling a booming drug trade and is considered a major transit point for smuggling cocaine into Europe. U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon, who urged voters to be peaceful, said he hoped the election would provide a clean start. \"The secretary-general hopes this election will mark a clear step forward for Guinea-Bissau in achieving political stability and security, and in fostering the social and economic conditions necessary to consolidate peace and fully realize human rights,\" Ban\\'s representative said in a statement.

But the rock megastar hadn\\'t banked on the local London council deciding to show him who was boss. At the climax of his three-hour set, Springsteen and McCartney, backed by the E Street Band and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, played a storming rendition of \"I Saw Her Standing There\" to a rapturous crowd. Springsteen\\'s delight was palpable: He grinned throughout, his face lit up like a child with a super-sized Christmas gift. The supergroup then segued into a sizzling version of \"Twist and Shout\" -- but as the night peaked against a backdrop of fireworks, a drably dressed man with sensible hair could be seen waving frantically at the back of the stage, indicating the rock legends\\' time was drawing to a close. Then, at 10:40 p.m. local time, as Springsteen and McCartney were winding up the extended \"Twist and Shout,\" the sound suddenly dampened, and went quiet. At first, the Boss didn\\'t seem to notice. He attempted to address the crowd, apparently unaware that they couldn\\'t hear him. But as it became clear that there was no amplification, he and lead guitarist Stevie Van Zandt played what looked to be a brief a cappella goodnight for the benefit of the front rows, shrugged, and left the stage. Van Zandt tweeted later, \"I\\'m sorry but I have to be honest I\\'m pissed ... It didn\\'t ruin the great night. But when I\\'m jamming with McCartney don\\'t bug me!\" He also implied his fans were denied their final number, saying, \"We would have been off by 11 if we\\'d done one more.\" London\\'s Westminster Council confirmed that concert organizers Hard Rock Calling had cut the power, saying they \"were sticking to their license for the event.\" According to the Hard Rock Calling website, Springsteen had been due to finish his set at 10:15 p.m. But Van Zandt tweeted, \"Hard Rock would have let us play all night,\" adding, \"Feel bad for our great fans ... It\\'s some City Council stupid rule.\" Audience reaction from CNN reporter on the scene . Conditions for holding concerts in London\\'s biggest central park have been tightened in the past year, the BBC reported, due to a rise in complaints from local residents. The Conservative-run council received 130 complaints about popular music events in the park in 2011. The events, which bring vital funding to the parks management, have been cut in number from 13 to nine and crowd size has been reduced from 80,000 to 65,000 maximum. Campaigners in the well-heeled borough have also sought a reduction in permitted noise levels. A spokesman for concert operator Live Nation said: \"It was unfortunate that the three hour plus performance by Bruce Springsteen was stopped right at the very end but the curfew is laid down by the authorities in the interest of the public\\'s health and safety. Road closures around Hyde Park are put in place at specific times to make sure everyone can exit the area safely.\" Properties around Hyde Park are some of the most desirable in London, and popular with bankers, foreign investors and politicians. Springsteen is known for his marathon sets. This night was no different. He\\'d come on stage at 7:30 p.m. and played without breaks for just over three hours, from a beautiful acoustic \"Thunder Road\" through an extensive list that included \"Badlands,\" \"Because the Night,\" \"Waitin\\' on a Sunny Day\" and \"The River.\" He then hit his high-energy closing set of \"Born in the USA,\" \"Born to Run,\" \"Glory Days\" and \"Dancing in the Dark\" before bringing on the former Beatle for the finale. But that wasn\\'t enough to satisfy his fans, who were left baffled, then angry that their idol\\'s set had been cut short. \"Ashamed to be British right now. Springsteen and McCartney playing \\'Twist & Shout\\' in Hyde Park and council pulled the plug cos of curfew,\" tweeted actor and comedian Stephen Merchant. British journalist Richard James tweeted, \"Springsteen and McCartney: Only in Britain could a local council pull the plug on the greatest artists of the last 50 years giving it all.\" Fan Liz Chong demanded the concert organizers apologize for cutting Springsteen and McCartney off mid-song, saying \"Won\\'t come again.\"',\n",

President Obama has once again argued that marijuana is just as dangerous as alcohol even after his own drug enforcement czar blasted the claims. 'I stand by my belief based on the scientific evidence that marijuana for casual users, individual users, is subject to abuse, just like alcohol is and should be treated as a public health problem and challenge,' he said during an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. He went on to stipulate that his motivation in speaking out on the topic isn’t so much focused on the health risks but more about the legal inequalities that come in handing down sentences for drug-related crimes. Sticking to his guns: President Obama said that he thinks the criminal sentences for marijuana do not match up to the severity of the drug and that should be fixed within the legal system . 'My concern is when you end up having very heavy criminal penalties for individual users that have been applied unevenly and, in some cases, with a racial disparity. I think that is a problem. ‘Over the long term, what I believe that if we can deal with some of the criminal penalty issues, then we can really tackle what is a problem not just for marijuana, but also alcohol, also cigarettes, also harder drugs and that is to see that our kids don't get into these habits in the first place. ‘The incarceration model that we have taken- particularly around marijuana- does not seem to produce the kind of goals that we've set. 'I think that is a problem. We're going to see what happens in the experiments in Colorado and Washington. The Department of Justice under Eric Holder has said that we are going to continue to enforce federal laws. Parsing the issue: He is still wary of wide-spread legalization because that could lead to increased marketing and promotion of the drug, and he views it should be viewed like similar 'vices' like alcohol and cigarettes . 'I think they have to ask themselves . some tough questions, too. Because if we start having a situation where . big corporations with lots of resources and distribution and marketing . arms are suddenly going out there, peddling marijuana, then the levels . of abuse that may take place are going to be higher,' he said. Mr . Obama has been open in his admissions about his own prior drug use, as . he first described his frequent dabbles with the drug in high school in . his memoir that was released when he was a Senator. The issue has come up again in recent weeks following an interview he gave to New Yorker editor David Remnick wherein he said that the drug is not as dangerous as it has been perceived and the laws surrounding it deserve to be revisited. The future: American opinion seems to be falling in line with Mr Obama following the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington State. Above, a legal Denver dispensary . 'As has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life. I don’t think it is more dangerous,' Mr Obama said in the New Yorker interview. 'Middle-class kids don’t get locked up for smoking pot, and poor kids do,' he said. 'And African-American kids and Latino kids are more likely to be poor and less likely to have the resources and the support to avoid unduly harsh penalties.' 'We should not be locking up kids or individual users for long stretches of jail time when some of the folks who are writing those laws have probably done the same thing,' Mr Obama added.\",\n",

A spaceship backed by Sir Richard Branson has made its first powered flight in a test that moves Virgin Galactic toward its goal of flying into space later this year. While SpaceShipTwo did not break out of the atmosphere during the test flight, it marked a significant milestone for Virgin Galactic, which intends to take passengers on suborbital joyrides. During the early morning flight, SpaceShipTwo, strapped beneath a twin-fuselage jet, took off from an airport runway in the Mojave Desert north of Los Angeles. Scroll down for video . Virgin Galactic's SpaceShip2 pictured during its first powered flight since the project began in 2005. The spacecraft was dropped from its 'mothership', WhiteKnight2 over the Mojave desert before firing its hybrid power motor and breaking the speed of sound . A frame from the Boom Camera mounted on SpaceShip 2 during its first rocket-powered flight . The craft did not break the atmosphere but the test moves Virgin Galactic toward its goal of flying into space later this year . The test began at 7:02 a.m. local . time when SS2 took off from Mojave Air and Space Port mated to . WhiteKnightTwo (WK2), Virgin Galactic’s carrier aircraft. Piloting SS2 were Mark Stucky, pilot, . and Mike Alsbury, co-pilot, who are test pilots for Scaled, which built . SS2 for Virgin Galactic. At the WK2 controls were Virgin . Galactic’s Chief Pilot Dave Mackay, assisted by Clint Nichols and Brian . Maisler, co-pilot and flight test engineer, respectively, for Scaled. Upon reaching 47,000 feet altitude and approximately 45 minutes into the flight, SS2 was released from WK2. After cross-checking data and . verifying stable control, the pilots triggered ignition of the rocket . motor, causing the main oxidizer valve to open and igniters to fire . within the fuel case. At this point, SS2 was propelled . forward and upward to a maximum altitude of 55,000 feet. The entire . engine burn lasted 16 seconds, as planned. During this time, SS2 went supersonic, achieving Mach 1.2. The entire rocket-powered flight test lasted just over 10 minutes, . culminating in a smooth landing for SS2 in Mojave at approximately 8 . a.m. local time. The jet released SpaceShipTwo, which ignited its engine for 16 seconds, then glided to a safe landing. Until now, SpaceShipTwo has only performed unpowered glide flights. Several powered flights are planned this summer, culminating with a dash into space targeted toward the end of the year. 'The first powered flight of Virgin . Spaceship Enterprise was without any doubt, our single most important . flight test to date,' said Virgin Galactic Founder Sir Richard Branson, . who was on the ground in Mojave to witness the occasion. 'For the first time, we were able to prove the key components of the system, fully integrated and in flight. 'Today’s supersonic success opens the . way for a rapid expansion of the spaceship’s powered flight envelope, . with a very realistic goal of full space flight by the year’s end. 'We saw history in the making today and I couldn’t be more proud of everyone involved.' SpaceShipTwo is the commercial version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 became the first private manned rocket to reach space. Since the historic flight, more than 500 aspiring space tourists have paid 200,000 dollars (£130,000) or placed deposits, waiting for a chance to float in weightlessness and view the Earth's curvature from 62 miles up.

Sir Richard initially predicted commercial flights would begin in 2007, but a deadly explosion during ground testing and longer-than-expected test flights pushed the deadline back. No date has been set for the first commercial flight from a custom-designed spaceport in New Mexico, but Virgin Galactic executives have said it will come after testing is complete and it secures approval from the government. 'The rocket motor ignition went as planned, with the expected burn duration, good engine performance and solid vehicle handling qualities throughout,' said Virgin Galactic President & CEO George Whitesides. 'The successful outcome of this test marks a pivotal point for our program. 'We will now embark on a handful of similar powered flight tests, and then make our first test flight to space.'

President Obama doesn’t believe comments made by Hillary Clinton about how she and former President Bill Clinton were ‘not only dead broke but in debt’ when they exited the White House in 2001 will become a big issue if she chooses to run for president. ‘As soon as you jump back into the spotlight in a more explicitly political way, you’re going to be fly-spec like this,’ the President told George Stephanopoulos in an interview aired on ABC’s This Week on Sunday. ‘She’s accustomed to it. Anybody who gets involved in public life is accustomed to it. Over time I don’t think it’s going to make a big difference.’ Scroll down for video . The President told George Stephanopoulos in an interview aired on ABC's This Week on Sunday that 'Hillary has been to this rodeo a bunch of times' and her comments wouldn't harm her chances in a presidential run . The President went on to say that his former Secretary of State has a political record that speaks for itself. ‘I think that Hillary has been to this rodeo a bunch of times,’ he said. ‘She is in public service [be]cause she cares about the same folks that I talked to here today. Her track record on that speaks for itself.’ The president comments come as a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Annenberg poll reveals that 55 percent of Americans say Hillary can relate to and understand the problems of average citizens as well as other presidential candidates can. By comparison, 37 percent of respondents disagreed, saying she can’t relate as well as other candidates can. 'Not really well off': Following a blistering 2012 presidential campaign in which Democrats pilloried Republican Mitt Romney for being super-wealthy and out of touch, Clinton risks falling into that category . The poll of 592 adults was conducted June 26-28 and it has a margin of error of plus-minus 5.1 percentage points. Clinton made the widely criticized comment while promoting her new book Hard Choices. 'We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,' she told ABC's Diane Sawyer, answering a question about the six-figure payments she and her husband command when giving paid speeches. Democrats argue that Clinton's personal wealth won't be able to overshadow a long career in public service, which began as an advocate for poor families at the Children's Defense Fund and led to years of work in Arkansas and Washington on issues such as early childhood education, expanded health care coverage and job creation. 'Attacks are most effective when they play into a pre-existing stereotype about a candidate,' said Ben LaBolt, a former Obama campaign spokesman. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton waves to the crowd as she arrives to sign copies of her new memoir at Books & Co. at The Greene in Beavercreek, Ohio, on Friday . 'Nobody thinks that Hillary Clinton spent her career focused on making money. She was in the public eye advocating for a policy agenda.' In the interview with PBS NewsHour broadcast on Wednesday, Clinton said her record 'speaks for itself' and her 'unartful use of those few words doesn't change who I am, what I've stood for my entire life, what I stand for today.' 'Bill and I have had terrific opportunities, both of us, you know, have worked hard,' she said. 'But we’ve been grateful for everything that we’ve been able to achieve, and sadly that’s just not true for most Americans today.' Video: President Obama speaking on ABC's This Week .\",\n",

Eric Hahn, 21, estimates he will be in debt for the next five to seven years for his undergraduate tuition. Just a few weeks later, Hahn, 21, was forced to cash in his savings and investments so he could make his rent and tuition after finding out that the lender, MyRichUncle.com, had suspended its private student loan program. \"Due to continued disruptions in the capital markets, combined with the continued demand we have experienced this year, we are reaching funding capacity limits,\" a message on his cell phone said, mimicking a statement on the company\\'s Web site. The sudden news left Hahn, a senior-year finance major, scrambling to find additional funding after maxing out his borrowing options from the federal government. Eventually, the country\\'s leading student loan provider, Sallie Mae, approved him for a private loan at 12 percent. After he graduates, Hahn estimates it will take him anywhere from five to seven years to repay about $30,000 he will have borrowed by then. \"Money isn\\'t cheap,\" said Hahn, who transferred to Georgia State University in Atlanta from the University of Connecticut last year because the tuition was less expensive. \"The process is time-consuming, and there\\'s also the stress of having to liquidate my investments and wonder where I\\'m going to find money.\" About 8 percent of student borrowers rely on private loans, which tend to be costlier and stricter than federal loans, said Robert Shierman, executive director of the Institute for College Access and Success. In doing so, Hahn and others like him are getting a crash course in market volatility and its effects on the consumer\\'s ability to find money.  Watch how the current economic troubles affect consumers » . MyRichUncle.com is the most recent lender to suspend its private student loan program, joining the ranks of major financial institutions like Wachovia and Bank of America and companies specializing in student loans such as College Loan Corporation and Campus Door, which was backed by Lehman Brothers. MyRichUncle\\'s president and co-founder, Raza Khan, told CNN: \"We are currently working with a number of investors so we can resume loan origination as soon as possible. \"Meanwhile, students and parents should not lose sight of the value of education. Funds do remain available -- we encourage families to do all the homework and research, and to make prudent decisions on borrowing,\" he added in a written statement. Since August 2007, 33 lenders have suspended private loans programs, according to the Web site FinAid.org, which tracks activity in the student loan market.  Unlike federal lending programs, private loans rely on liquidity from investors. Even though private loans are considered strong by industry standards, they are feeling the effects of a turbulent capital market. \"The only reason lenders had to stop making the loans was that they ran out of liquidity,\" said financial aid expert Mark Kantrowitz, who created FinAid.org. \"It\\'s a contagion effect of the sub-prime crisis,\" said Kantrowitz. \"It\\'s an overreaction that has affected the student loan market.\" With their strong resemblance to consumer loans, where lenders set the terms based on your credit score, financial advisers often recommended private loans as a means of last resort. But with rising tuition and increased enrollment putting a squeeze on the student aid market -- which disbursed about $60 billion in federal funds and $17 billion in private loans last year -- students are turning to private loans after they\\'ve exhausted all other avenues, or for expenses that federal aid won\\'t cover. In response, Congress passed legislation this year to increase the maximum amount of federal loans that students can obtain. \"With federal student loan limits increasing, you can borrow now more than last year, regardless of income, assets, collateral or income,\" said Martha Holler, vice president of corporate communications of Sallie Mae. Despite the uncertainty in the capital market, many lenders, including Sallie Mae, are still able to offer private student loans by securing lines of credit and raising liquidity on their own. Holler says other options also exist, from scholarships for skills as random as skateboarding, to tuition payment plans -- an interest-free option that allows borrowers to make payments in monthly installments. But students like Hahn remain on the fringe. Even after being awarded an out-of-state tuition waiver, which lets him pay the same tuition as a resident from Georgia, he says he has borrowed all he can in federal loans. His parents, who are facing their own financial struggles, can\\'t co-sign for a loan with a lower interest rate or better terms. Nevertheless, Hahn has accepted his fate. As school begins, he is returning his focus to his studies. \"It\\'s a pain in the neck, but it is what it is,\" he said in a telephone interview in between classes Wednesday. \"The reason this all happened is due to the credit crisis and the housing crisis. So I guess the lesson is don\\'t hop on what everyone else is doing.\" CNN\\'s Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report .',\n",

Broadcaster Andrew Marr has revealed his major stroke has left him unable to type. The BBC presenter today made his first appearance at a public event since the serious stroke in January this year which damaged his left arm and leg, leaving him needing intensive physiotherapy. But as he prepares to return to the airwaves next month grilling Britain’s top politicians, the former newspaper journalist disclosed the progress he has made on the road to recovery. Scroll down for video . Return: Broadcaster Andrew Marr made his first appearance at public event since suffering a major stroke at the Edinburgh International Book Festival . Recovery: The 53-year-old author revealed his revised version of his book The Battle For Scotland had to be updated using a dictation machine because he had been left unable to type . Marr, 53, was rushed to hospital after being taken unwell seven months ago. Doctors warned his wife, journalist Jackie Ashley, he might not survive the bleeding in his brain and that if he lived he could be left unable to move, see, speak or hear. Following months of rehabilitation, he is now preparing to return to broadcasting full-time next month. But speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, he said he was still unable to perform some basic tasks. He said: ‘I can\\'t type because my left arm is still no good. I used to touch-type but I can\\'t any more. I used to think I could only think through my fingers.’ Comeback: Marr is due to return to hosting his Sunday morning political show next month . Physio: The serious stroke in January damaged Marr\\'s left arm and leg, and means he has to walk with a stick . He said a revised version of his 1992 book The Battle For Scotland had been updated using a dictation machine. Marr, the corporation\\'s former political editor, began his career as a newspaper reporter, becoming the editor of The Independent before turning to television. He has also presented a number of history programmes along with his politics show and has had five books published. He has previously blamed a combination of overwork and excessive exercise for his stroke. ‘I had a major stroke, I\\'m frankly lucky to be alive. I had been heavily overworking - mostly my own fault - in the year before that,’ he said in April. He is due to return to full-time presenting this autumn, taking up the helm again on BBC1\\'s Andrew Marr Show from September 1 and is also returning to Radio 4\\'s Start The Week. Grilling: Marr has been off TV screens since being taken ill in January, but did record an interview with Prime Minister David Cameron in June . Marr worked to update his book on Scottish politics ahead of next year\\'s referendum on independence. He predicted it would be \\'\"much closer than the polls suggest\\' and there was still a \\'lot to play for\\'. But he admitted there was a \\'very strong anti-English feeling\\' in Scotland, adding: \\'I don\\'t think it is particularly serious most of the time, but it can become serious, it can become toxic.\\' He hailed Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond as \\'some kind of political genius\\' but after being in power for some time is now \\'struggling with the gilt rubbing off a little bit\\'. The Glasgow-born journalist also revealed he would choose a Scottish passport should Scotland vote yes next year. \\'I am a Scot, so it would have to be a Scottish passport and not an English passport,\\' he said.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'One-third of America\\'s youth is now overweight or obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Norwood, Massachusetts, 14-year-old Maria Caprigno no longer wants to be one of those statistics. Maria has been overweight since she was about 3 years old and as she got older, she just got heavier. She told CNN her eating habits were to blame. \"I\\'m a junk-food person and because I\\'m a couch potato I don\\'t like to get off the couch,\" she said. \"It\\'s also kind of just like my genes: Both my parents are heavy and that\\'s just the environment I was raised in.\" Maria said people have stared at her all her life because of her weight. \"The first thing that goes through their mind is, \\'Why is she so fat?\\' And, \\'Oh my god, she\\'s so fat. Why doesn\\'t she just hop on a treadmill?\\' And I think people don\\'t really understand that it\\'s not just exercising ... it\\'s extremely hard. See Maria growing up in pictures . \"I get self-conscious,\" she said. \"I don\\'t like to go to crowded places -- like if a mall\\'s crowded, I\\'ll sit in the car.\" The CDC says obesity rates for Maria\\'s age group, those 12 to 19 years old, have tripled since 1980. Maria pleaded with her mother to find a doctor who would perform weight-loss surgery on teenagers. Dr. Evan Nadler, who started a program for adolescent surgery at National Children\\'s Hospital in Washington, said he felt \"compelled\" to help Maria. \"Her BMI [body mass index], which is a measurement we use to determine how obese someone is, put her in the highest risk category. Not just morbidly obese but two categories higher than that,\" Nadler said. \"So I felt that withholding a known therapy that works based on her age alone was really almost unethical.\" Between 2000 and 2003, some 800 teenagers went under the knife to lose weight, Nadler said. Before she was approved for surgery, Maria had to meet with a nutritionist, a pediatric cardiologist and a psychologist. In the end, Maria was approved for an experimental procedure known as a \"gastrectomy,\" during which about 80 percent of the stomach is removed, including the part of the stomach that controls appetite. Nadler said the procedure \"basically restricts the amount of food that can come into the stomach at any one time and it really makes the patient have a sense of fullness or a lack of hunger.\" Maria had the \"gastrectomy\" last month and already has lost about 45 pounds. Today she weighs 400 pounds and is down to a size 32. Maria said she would like one day to be a size 12 but isn\\'t trying to reach a specific weight. \"It\\'s not about the numbers; I want to be at a healthy size,\" she said. \"I want to be able to go into a normal store and buy something and be able to wear it. I want to be able to run. I haven\\'t been able to run since I was 5 years old. I want to be able wear a bathing suit without feeling embarrassed. \"I just want to be normal.\" But Dr. Edward Livingston, a Texas surgeon who also has helped adolescents lose weight, said surgery for teenagers can be risky. He has turned away most teens sent to him for evaluation, he said, and has operated only on those more than 500 pounds with serious health risks such as blood clots and congestive heart failure. \"Adults are a different matter because they are more emotionally mature,\" Livingston said. \"They know what risks they want to take and they can buy into the procedure. Kids don\\'t really know what they\\'re getting into, so I think you have to be really careful with children before doing these operations on them.\" Livingston noted that only a limited number of studies have been done on weight-loss surgery\\'s effects on teenagers later in life. \"We don\\'t really know the full spectrum of positive or negative outcomes for the procedures,\" he said. Nadler, who operated on Maria, said he fully agrees that \"we need to study this more. But I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to the Marias of the world to keep them from having this procedure based on their age alone.\" In his own study, Nadler followed 41 teenagers for two years after weight-loss surgery. He said they lost half their excess body weight and their health had improved. Maria said she was well aware of the risks of surgery, but after trying about a dozen different diets, she said, surgery was her only option. Now, she said, she is well on her way to becoming a healthy teen and adult. She works out playing the Wii video game and walks every day with her brother after school. She is eating a high-protein diet. \"This surgery is a tool in your tool box to becoming healthy,\" she said. \"It is not the quick fix. You need a lot more. You need to exercise you need to make the right food choices.\" In a letter to the insurance company seeking coverage for this procedure, Maria wrote she needed this surgery to make it to her 15th birthday. She said, \"Doctors have told me for years that if I keep gaining weight I\\'m not going to see 18 and that has terrified me. I want to live. I want to do so many things.\"',\n",

Berdych won 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 3-6 6-3 in under three hours in Wednesday\\'s evening session to reach the semifinals for the first time at Flushing Meadows. \"I just didn\\'t come up with the goods tonight,\" said Federer, in quotes carried on the official tournament website, after his first match in four days following a walkover against American Mardy Fish. \"He probably created more than I did, and that\\'s why he ended up winning.\" Sharapova to face No. 1 Azarenka in U.S. Open semis . Federer made his earliest exit in New York since 2003 and now has an 11-5 record against the 26-year-old -- who beat him at the 2004 Olympics and at Wimbledon in 2010, when he went on to lose in the final. Berdych will face Olympic champion Andy Murray in the last four, after the Scot came back from a set down to oust giant Croatian Marin Cilic, winning 3-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 6-0. Cilic, who will be left to rue a number of missed opportunities, surrendered a 5-1 lead in the second set. This proved to be a turning point for the resurgent Murray, who finally found his rhythm as his confidence grew. All of a sudden, he had answers to the 12th seed\\'s massive serve and booming forehand as he breezed through the next two sets to earn a place in the semis. The match had been moved from the main Arthur Ashe Stadium to the Louis Armstrong court, and 2008 U.S. Open finalist Murray struggled in front of an initially small crowd against a player who beat him at the same tournament three years ago. \"You have to be able to create your own atmosphere when you\\'re on the court, but I did play better when the crowd filled up,\" said Murray, still seeking his first grand slam title after losing to Federer in July\\'s Wimbledon final. \"It\\'s a quicker court. When you switch from one court to the other, it can take time to get into a rhythm. I have never played particularly well on that court.\" Earlier, 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro brought the curtain down on Andy Roddick\\'s glittering career by beating the home favorite in four sets in their rain-delayed fourth-round match on Arthur Ashe. Roddick, the last U.S. male to win a grand slam when he triumphed in New York in 2003, announced last week that it would be his last tournament. The former world No. 1 met his match against the seventh-seeded Argentinian, who will play defending champion Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. When play resumed after being tied at 6-6 in the first set from Tuesday, Roddick took the tiebreaker but he could make no further progress against the 23-year-old Olympic bronze medalist. There were no breaks of service in the second, but Del Potro took the tiebreaker and then proceeded to dominate, completing a 6-7 (1-7) 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 6-4 victory. Roddick was visibly emotional in the final game on the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court and received a huge ovation from the crowd as he bowed out. \"Playing the last five games was pretty hard. Once I got down a break, I could barely look at my (players) box,\" Roddick said. \"I don\\'t know what the emotions are. I\\'m a little overwhelmed right now. I normally feel like I can grasp things pretty quickly and clearly. I certainly don\\'t feel that way right now.\" World No. 2 Djokovic had easier progress, as his opponent Stanislas Wawrinka was forced to retire when trailing by two sets and 3-1 in the third. The Swiss 18th seed complained of feeling ill as the rain-delayed match came to a swift conclusion. \"It\\'s an unfortunate situation that happened with him, but I felt that I was hitting the ball well in the last two sets before that happened,\" said Djokovic, who reached his sixth successive U.S. Open quarterfinal, having dropped just 20 games in four matches. \"Hopefully I can keep that going for the next match.\" His fellow Serbian, eighth seed Janko Tipsarevic, reached the last eight at Flushing Meadows for the second straight year as he eased past Germany\\'s No. 19 Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-2. He will next play Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer, who has been in equally fine form in the final grand slam of the season.',\n",

The human rights organization Monday urged Guatemala to shore up its fight against impunity and address the more than 685 killings of women reported in 2010 alone. Amnesty International\\'s call comes ahead of International Women\\'s Day on Tuesday. \"Women in Guatemala are dying as a consequence of the state\\'s failure to protect them,\" Sebastian Elgueta, Guatemala researcher at Amnesty International, said in a statement. \"High levels of violence and a lack of political will, along with a track record of impunity, mean authorities are both unable to pursue perpetrators, or just don\\'t care. Perpetrators know they will not be punished.\" The Central American country\\'s culture of impunity is a legacy of its 36-year civil war that ended in 1996, the organization said. There were hundreds of thousands human rights violations that were never accounted for, Amnesty said. In a speech last year, Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said his country has made strides in protecting women. \"Today we have tribunals specialized in femicide, we have offices for attention (to women\\'s rights), we have centers, but once again, this will won\\'t be enough until we finally defeat the social scourge of women\\'s murders, regardless of the reason, justification or other type of cheap excuse,\" Colom said. Passing laws is not enough, Elgueta said. \"The government must initiate effective investigations into killings, improve police training and ensure prosecutions are effective,\" he said. The special tribunals have not been effective, Amnesty said. \"The gender of the woman is often a determining factor in the motive of the crime, the way in which the authorities respond to the case and the way women are killed,\" the organization said. Rosa Franco has been fighting for justice after her 15-year-old daughter, Maria Isabel Franco, was raped and killed in December 2001. But no one has been arrested in the case, Amnesty said. Franco has received death threats and harassment because of her search for justice, the organization said. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights took Maria Isabel Franco\\'s case on the grounds that it was being unjustifiably delayed by authorities. \"If the police had started the investigation early, maybe they would\\'ve found Maria Isabel alive,\" Rosa Franco told Amnesty. \"Their attitude, not only in the case of my daughter, but in the cases of thousands of women who have been killed, has been terrible.\" On Tuesday, some 60 organizations will march down the principal streets of Guatemala City to commemorate International Women\\'s Day, the state-run AGN news agency reported. The march will start in front of the supreme court. \"With this activity, Guatemalan women will demand the respect and the meeting of their needs and urge plans to solve the problems of poverty, discrimination, lack of opportunities, among others,\" activist Sandra Moran told AGN.

This seemed to have a cascading effect on their overall social dynamics and reproductive success.\\n\\nI imagine the red wolves you're studying could be experiencing something similar, given the habitat loss and human encroachment they're facing. It might be worth looking at their social structure and seeing if there are any signs of stress or disruption that could be linked to human activity.\\n\\nI'd be curious to learn more about the specifics of your project and the challenges you're facing with the red wolves. Do you have time for a call sometime next week to discuss this further? I'm free on Tuesday afternoon if that works for you.\\n\\nLooking forward to catching up and hopefully collaborating on this important work. And let's make sure to grab a coffee and reminisce about that conference in Yellowstone when we have a chance!\\n\\nBest,\\nAlex\",\n",

Van Persie limped out of United’s defeat at home to Southampton on Sunday and was forced to cancel plans to travel to Zurich for the Ballon d’Or awards ceremony where he had been nominated for Goal of the Year. However, tests have revealed no serious damage and Van Persie is only expected to be ruled out of this weekend’s game at QPR. Robin van Persie (left) hobbled out of Manchester United's defeat at home to Southampton on Sunday . Ander Herrera replaces van Persie during the second half of the defeat to Southampton at Old Trafford . The 31-year-old should be available for the trip to Cambridge United in the FA Cup a week on Friday, although he was rested for United’s game at Yeovil in the last round when Van Gaal gave James Wilson an opportunity to impress. The news on Van Persie is less positive for Falcao who is desperate for a run in the team to persuade United to make his loan move from Monaco permanent in the summer. The Colombia star was surprisingly axed from the 18-man squad for the Southampton match by Van Gaal, casting further doubt over United’s intentions to go ahead with a £52million deal. Radamel Falcao is given a tough welcome to England by Stoke City defender Marc Wilson at Old Trafford . Falcao has struggled to make an impact for Manchester United this season and would cost up to \\xa0£52 million . Falcao is expected to regain his place against QPR in Van Persie’s absence on Saturday, but his return to the starting line-up may be shortlived. His agent Jorge Mendes admitted earlier this week that he was unsure if the former FC Porto and Atletico Madrid striker would stay at Old Trafford beyond this season after starting only eight games so far. ‘I don’t know (if he will stay),’ said Mendes. ‘He is a fantastic player and I think it’s very difficult for Manchester United fans. They have an absolutely brilliant player, one of the very best in the world, who would without any doubt play 90 minutes, every time, with any other club. ‘The truth is, now, we don’t know what will happen. What we do know is that he will play for one of the very best clubs in the world next season, whether that is Manchester United or not. I am 100 per cent sure of that. But you know how football works, we’ll see what happens.’ Falcao and Van Gaal walk side-by-side following his arrival on-loan from Ligue One side Monaco in the summer . Van Gaal dropped Colombian striker Falcao from the squad for the defeat against Southampton on Sunday . One striker certain to be leaving United is Angelo Henriquez after the club agreed a transfer fee in the region of £1m with Dinamo Zagreb. Henriquez cost £4m when he moved to Old Trafford in the summer of 2012 from Universidad de Chile but never played a competitive game for United, scoring once in a pre-season friendly against Swedish club AIK a year later. He went out on loan to Wigan and Real Zaragoza before making a season-long move to Zagreb where he has scored 10 goals so far this season. Dinamo Zagreb coach Zoran Mamic (left) confirms that a deal for Angelo Henriquez \\xa0(right) has been agreed . The deal included an option for the Croatian side to sign Henriquez permanently in the summer, and coach Zoran Mamic confirmed that terms have now been agreed. With so many star names in Van Gaal’s squad, Henriquez had already indicated that his future would probably lie away from Old Trafford. ‘We have bought him outright,’ said Mamic. ‘Taking Henriquez depends on us, not on Manchester United. We took him with the right of first refusal, which stands at around €1.5m, and we have already signed a contract with him for the summer. There is no longer any doubt – he is ours and the story is resolved.’ Meanwhile,\\xa0FC Midtjylland of Denmark have failed with a bid for United’s Danish keeper Anders Lindegaard. Lindegaard is for sale after Victor Valdes signed, but the clubs cannot agree a fee and the keeper would prefer to join a bigger team.

But a doctor who prescribed drugs to the pop singer using a fake name shortly before the singer\\'s death could be disciplined by the California medical board, according to Christine Gasparac, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Jerry Brown. Investigators did not find sufficient evidence to recommend criminal prosecution of any of the medical practitioners, she said. She would not identify the doctor referred to the medical board for consideration of administrative action or the others who were cleared. Dr. Conrad Murray, who was Jackson\\'s personal physician when he died a year ago, was not part of the probe, Gasparac said. Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter earlier this year in the entertainer\\'s death. The Los Angeles Police Department asked the California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement to investigate the prescription practices of seven doctors and a nurse, Gasparac said. \"After reviewing hundreds of pages of records and documents obtained from the medical practitioners, the attorney general\\'s office has referred one doctor, who wrote prescriptions to an alias known to have been used by Jackson, to the California medical board for further review,\" she said. State drug agents executed search warrants at several doctors\\' offices last summer and at least one pharmacy. Agents spent several hours inside the Mickey Fine Pharmacy just below the Beverly Hills practice of Dr. Arnold Klein, Jackson\\'s dermatologist. Investigators also visited Klein\\'s office, where Jackson was seen several times in the weeks before his June 25, 2009 death. Klein told CNN last year that he never prescribed dangerous drugs to the singer. Searches of Jackson\\'s rented mansion revealed a long list of prescription drugs in his bedroom after his death, according to court documents and the autopsy report. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson\\'s death was from an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep. A consultant\\'s report included in the autopsy said the level of lorazepam, a powerful anti-anxiety agent found in Jackson\\'s body \"would have accentuated the respiratory and cardiovascular depression from propofol.\" CNN\\'s Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.',\n",

Now, BMW believes it has come up with a solution by using street lighting to charge up cars while they're parked, allowing them to run for longer. The German car manufacturer said it will run a pilot project in Munich next year that uses existing local authority lighting networks to power their vehicles. BMW has made two prototype 'Light and Charge' street lights, which combine Light Emitting Diodes (LED) with the company's ChargeNow recharging stations.

'Seamless charging infrastructure is essential if we want to see more electric vehicles on the road in our cities in the future,' Peter Schwarzenbauer, member of the board of management of BMW AG, said. The Munich pilot will install the first charging lights, which can be grafted straight onto the existing local authority street lighting infrastructure, BMW said. These additional charging stations can be used by as many drivers as possible, regardless of vehicle model and electricity provider. Two street lights (artist's impression left) are already installed in front of the BMW headquarters (right) and drivers can pay to charge their cars via a mobile phone app . Two street lights are already installed in front of the BMW headquarters and drivers can pay to charge their cars via a mobile phone app. The company  has already developed some of the most advanced electric cars, including the i3 city vehicle and i8 hybrid. But electric cars have struggled to gain widespread popularity due to their limited operating range, the scarcity of charging stations and the time it takes to recharge them. Motorways are to become ‘electric superhighways’ in an attempt to persuade drivers to switch to battery-powered cars. ‘Supercharging stations’ are to be installed on several major roads by the end of the year, enabling electric cars to travel across the country in one trip for the first time. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is fitting the devices, which can charge the Tesla electric cars his company makes, in 20 minutes, giving a range of 130 miles (209km) . This is significantly faster than most current electric cars, which often require overnight charging and have a range of under 100 miles (160km). It means electric car owners will be able to drive large distances across Britain without concerns about running out of power, known as ‘range anxiety’. The first network will stretch from Dover to London along the M20, cover the entire M25 and follow the M4 from London to Bristol and the M1 and M6 to Manchester via Birmingham. Tesla declined to say which service stations would be used, but installation work was reported to be almost complete on the South Mimms services at the junction of the M25 and the A1 in Hertfordshire. In addition to developing street lighting, BMW has already invested in software and applications that aim to help drivers of electric cars find parking spaces and charging stations. The group also recently met with rival Tesla Motors to discuss the availability of electric vehicle charging stations. In September, Daimler said it had bought my taxi and RideScout, two smartphone applications that will help the maker of Mercedes-Benz limousines provide services to people who do not own cars.

They kick and scream and cry and complain and repeat the cycle at varying volumes until you reach your destination. While there’s little you can do solve the problem in its entirety - save leave them behind - there are a few things you can do to prevent some of the worst tantrums and forearm yourself for the open road. Scroll down for video . Happy families: Travelling with children is hellish but there are things you can do to prevent the worst tantrums . 1.) Book seats by the plane’s engine . Who’d have guessed it? One of the best things to rock-a-bye-baby is the roar of an engine. According to The Art of Manliness, who swear by the tip given to them by from an experienced air stewardess, although the engine is loud; ‘the womb was incredibly loud too – and they’ll think they’re back in their happy place.’ As an engine’s location varies from plane to plane  you’ll need to find out what type of plane you are flying in then use Google to see where that aircraft’s engines are located before choosing your seat. Out for the count: Choose a seat that's close to the plane's engine if travelling with a baby to make them sleep . 2.) Surprise present . TV presenter and consumer champion Sarah Willingham has a useful trick to stem the bawling if you’re little one has past the point of no return. Before you get into the car/train/plane secretly wrap up one of their favourite toys without telling them. At the right moment hand it over for them to unwrap. It can't fail to make them smile and will calm them down quickly. Surprise surprise: Secretly wrap up your child's favourite toy and present them with it to calm them down . 3.) Do your homework . There are a few sites such as Skyscanner and Seat Guru which can keep you abreast of unexpected charges, requirements or rules when flying with a baby or child. Some airlines such as easyjet and Aer Lingus give free priority boarding with an infant under two, some let you carry on pushchairs and car seats free of charge. Find out which. Seatguru is especially good for detailed information about amenities such as bassinets, whether you have to reserve a separate seat for your baby and what type of car seats are allowed on board. Disclaimer: This is a model family, it's highly unlikely you will ever look as happy as them in an airport unless you take careful precautions . Sites such as Skyscanner and Seat Guru help keep you abreast of unexpected charges, requirements or rules . 4.) Sit at the back . If you can’t sit near the engine, sit at the back of the plane. As Sara Esther Crispe, co-director of Interinclusion.org and mother-of-four writes on The Jewish Woman, you'll be closer to the bathrooms, less likely to bother other passengers and possibly have more help from flight attendants.\\xa0You're going to have to wait for the push chair or stroller when you get off the plane anyway. Back is best: You'll be closer to the bathrooms, less likely to annoy others and be closer to flight attendents . Careful planning: Follow these tips and you might just make it to your destination without falling to pieces . 5.) Get a travel jacket . Imagine Bear Grylls circumnavigating  Borneo's rainforest in Southeast Asia. That's the jacket you need to buy. According to The Art of Manliness, you’ll need all sorts of accouterments - from sweets to pens and paper and tissues -  to placate the small ones and a purpose built travel jacket, with its many, many pockets, means you can easily access them at any time. Plus, it doubles as a blanket if they get cold. Just ensure it’s lightweight so you can fold it up and stow it in your luggage when not needed. Be prepared: Buy an unattractive but practical jacket which has room for supplies and doubles up as a blanket . 6.) Book the shortest route . While this isn’t rocket science, if you have a multi-leg trip involving train changes or more than one flight it’s key to plan with military precision. Sites like kayak.com can sort results into travel time so you can choose the faster route. Equally, if you do have to have a stopover, leave at least an hour for children to stretch their legs, attack each other and have something to eat. If you have a stopover ensure you leave  an hour for young ones to stretch, eat and get rid of some energy . Pack one of everything: Prevent fights over who wants to use the blue crayon by giving everyone their own set . 7.) Pack one of everything . It will save countless arguments. Give each child their own version of everything that’s practical too. This is especially important with crayons, according to Sara Esther Crispe. If they have their own pack they won’t fight over the best colours and you’ll have a better journey. Take one spare change of clothes for everyone and at least one plastic bag per person, which you will use for everything from rubbish and cleaning up disasters to emergency bags and keeping things dry after spillages.\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"Boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. has accused the NFL of overreacting to the video of former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City casino elevator which emerged on Monday. In the light of the shocking video, Rice was fired by the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL, but according to Mayweather the organization had got it right when it originally handed the NFL star just a two-game suspension during the summer. 'I think there's a lot worse things that go on in other people's households, also,' Mayweather told reporters at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas on Tuesday. 'It's just not caught on video, if that's safe to say.' Scroll down for video . Boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. has accused the NFL of overreacting to the video of former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee  which emerged on Monday . The undefeated five-division world champion has had his own domestic abuse issues and currently faces a trial by jury after his ex-fiancee filed an explosive civil lawsuit last week. Shantel Jackson claims the fighter subjected her to years of torment through physical and emotional abuse including preventing her from leaving his Las Vegas mansion. In 2012 the boxer spent two months in a Las Vegas jail for a domestic violence attack in which he twisted ex-girlfriend Josie Harris's arm in front of two of their young children. Mayweather still maintains his innocence even after pleading to reduced domestic abuse charges in the 2012 case. Had he not taken the plea bargain, the boxer would have gone to trial on felony charges that could have gotten him up to 34 years in prison. On Tuesday Mayweather said he has been falsely accused many times. Ray Rice was fired by the Baltimore Ravens on Monday and a day later his wife Janay Rice released a statement supporting her husband and criticizing the media for drawing attention to the incident in February . Explosive video footage released on Monday showed Ray Rice punch his then fiancee unconscious and led to him being indefinitely suspended from the NFL . 'Like I've said in the past, no bumps, no bruises, no nothing,' he said. 'With O.J. and Nicole, you seen pictures. With Chris Brown and Rihanna, you seen pictures. With (Chad) Ochocinco and Evelyn, you seen pictures. 'You guys have yet to see any pictures of a battered woman, a woman who says she was kicked and beaten (by Mayweather). So I just live my life and try to stay positive, and try to become a better person each and every day.' Both the NFL and the Ravens broke their silence on Tuesday about their respective decisions to punish Rice more harshly in the wake of Monday’s video. Commissioner Roger Goodell told CBS that ‘no one in the NFL, to my knowledge’ had seen a new video of what happened on the elevator until it was posted online. ‘We assumed that there was a video. We asked for video. But we were never granted that opportunity,’ Goodell said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, left, and Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, right, broke their silence on Tuesday about their respective decisions to punish Rice more harshly in the wake of Monday's video . In a letter to fans, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said the team should have done more to get the video as the investigation continued, and it was a ‘mistake’ not to. He said the team tried to get the video from both the casino and law enforcement, but the casino wouldn't share it and that authorities refused. It is common for law enforcement to decline to release evidence when an investigation is ongoing. ‘We should have seen it earlier. We should have pursued our own investigation more vigorously,’ the letter said. ‘We didn't and we were wrong.’ According to court papers seen by Mail Online, Floyd Mayweather is accused of battering, blackmailing, imprisoning and stealing from his former lover Shantel Jackson. The 29-year-old model announced she was suing Mayweather last week, claiming at a press conference that he beat her and invaded her privacy by posting a picture of an ultrasound scan online and announcing that they broke up because she aborted their twin babies. But in sensational court documents the full extent of the boxer's tumultuous on-off eight year relationship with the beauty is laid bare in painful detail. Shantel Jackson, right, ex-fiancee of boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., breaks down as she reads a statement with her attorney Gloria Allred looking on after announcing a lawsuit against the boxer for battery, assault, invasion of privacy, defamation and false imprisonment . Shantel says she suffered years of hell at the hands of Mayweather, 37, whose ‘outrageous acts’ caused her ‘pain and humiliation’. During one argument, he allegedly choked and twisted her arm, while in another he held her at gun point and threatened to shoot her. He also kept her ‘prisoner’ in his Las Vegas home, threatened to publish naked pictures he had secretly taken of her while she slept and stole thousands of dollars worth of belongings from her, her court filings claim. And in raging verbal attacks he called her a ‘bum’ and a ‘b*tch’ telling her, ‘You're not sh*t without me. I made you who you are.’ Shantel is seeking unspecified damages from Mayweather for battery, assault, defamation, invasion of privacy, false imprisonment, harassment and infliction of emotional distress. The case is due to be tried by jury in Los Angeles and is expected to last seven days, court papers show. Shantel says she suffered years of hell at the hands of Mayweather, 37, whose ‘outrageous acts’ caused her 'pain and humiliation' Stunning Shantel met the boxer in 2006 when she was aged 21 and working as a hostess at an event in Atlanta, Georgia. The pair began dating and soon after Mayweather asked her to move in with him in Las Vegas. The boxer, who was last year named the highest paid athlete of the year by Forbes, showered her with gifts including a 17 carat diamond worth $2,500,000, over 100 designer handbags and masses of designer clothing . He also lavished her with ‘substantial cash gifts’ and allowed her to use his credit card. However, Mayweather soon became very controlling and Shantel had to ‘make herself available to him virtually at all times’ and was not allowed to work, according to the lawsuit filed on Thursday at the Superior Court of California. Shantel, who changed her last name to ‘Jackson-Mayweather’ at the boxing champ's request, stood by her man when he was jailed in 2012 for a domestic violence attack in which he twisted ex-girlfriend Josie Harris's arm in front of two of their young children. Court papers state that during a jealous rage, Mayweather twisted Shantel's arm, then 'choked her and forcibly took her phone away from her to look through it.' \\xa0Just a week later he begged for forgiveness and promised 'he would never assault her again' the documents continue . But just days after his release from prison, Mayweather allegedly lashed out at her in almost the same way as he had attacked his ex. The court papers state that during a jealous rage, the undefeated boxer twisted Shantel's arm, then ‘choked her and forcibly took her phone away from her to look through it.’ Just a week later Mayweather begged for forgiveness and promised ‘he would never assault her again’ the documents continue. Mayweather made his controversial remarks regarding Ray Rice before a small group of reporters at the MGM Grand hotel, where he made a formal fight week arrival for his rematch on Saturday with Argentina's Marcos Maidana. Mayweather won a majority decision over Maidana in May but was roughed up at times in perhaps the toughest of his recent string of fights. The unbeaten 37-year-old also said he plans to fight just twice more after Maidana, finishing his career next September. He didn't specifically dismiss Manny Pacquiao as an opponent for one of those bouts - as he has repeatedly done in the past - though he said reports there had been talks on a possible fight were completely false.\",\n",

He also pointed out that there are no visible signs of abuse in the Rice case, unlike other high-profile domestic violence cases. Meanwhile, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti acknowledged that the league and team should have pursued the video more aggressively. Goodell stated that the NFL had not seen the video until it was released online, while Bisciotti admitted the team made a mistake by not obtaining it earlier.

Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: You can beware the Ides of March, but there\\'s nothing to fear about today\\'s broadcast of CNN Student News. Reporting from the CNN Center, I\\'m Carl Azuz. First Up: Health Care Push . AZUZ: First up, President Obama postpones a trip overseas so that he can stay in Washington and work on health care. He\\'s called it the top priority for the U.S., and the president, along with Democratic leaders in Congress, all think it\\'s important for him to stay in the U.S. to help rally support for the health care reform bill being considered by lawmakers. A House committee is scheduled to hold a vote on it today. Republicans are against President Obama\\'s health care plan. Some want to scrap it and start over. Yesterday, on CNN\\'s \"State of the Union\" with Candy Crowley, a top Republican in Congress talked about why a health care bill hasn\\'t passed yet, and President Obama\\'s top political adviser discussed why it might pass now. REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) MINORITY LEADER: They tried to do this in June and July last year. If they had the votes, then it would be law. They tried to pass it in September, October, November, December, January, February. Guess what? They don\\'t have the votes. The American people don\\'t want to take the step toward government-run health insurance. It\\'s a dangerous step, because we do have the best health care system in the world. DAVID AXELROD, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISER: We\\'re very optimistic about the outcome of this process. I think people have come to the realization that this is the moment, and if we don\\'t act now, there\\'ll be dire consequences for people all over this country. Severe Weather . AZUZ: Heading up the coast to the northeastern U.S. now, where some areas are recovering from severe storms over the weekend. And we mean huge storms. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania: all of them hit with heavy rains and hurricane force winds gusting over 70 miles per hour. The storms knocked down trees, affected air travel, left more than half a million people without power. One official said part of the reason the trees and utility poles fell over is because the ground was so wet from all the snow that the region\\'s been hit with this winter. The force of nature also being felt on the other side of North America. An avalanche struck a snowmobile competition in British Columbia, Canada on Saturday. As of yesterday afternoon, authorities said two people had been killed and 30 others were injured. USNS Comfort . AZUZ: The USNS Comfort is on its way back home after spending nearly two months helping out earthquake victims in Haiti. The Navy hospital ship is expected to arrive at its home pier in Baltimore, Maryland by the end of this week. Saturday, the Comfort pulled in to Norfolk, Virginia. It had been in the harbor of Port-au-Prince since January, a base for medical care for victims of the catastrophic quake that hit Haiti. Staff on the Comfort performed more than 800 surgeries during the mission. There were times when 10 different operating rooms on the ship were all running simultaneously. Female Football Coach . AZUZ: Natalie Randolph, whom you see right here, is a science teacher at Calvin Coolidge Senior High in Washington, D.C. Science teacher, though, is not her only title. Randolph is the school\\'s new, head varsity football coach. She\\'s been an assistant coach at other schools and she\\'s played women\\'s professional football. It is extremely rare for a high school football team to have a female coach, and some women\\'s groups are calling this announcement historic. Randolph says history is not her focus. NATALIE RANDOLPH, COOLIDGE HIGH SCHOOL HEAD FOOTBALL COACH: Some people will undoubtedly want to focus on my gender, and they\\'ll focus on the historical meaning of this day. But I would much rather focus on something that all dedicated coaches already know: I\\'m here to give these young men, these student athletes, these wonderful students, the best opportunity and guidance to succeed in the classroom, make good decisions at home, and perform well on the football field. And while I\\'m proud to be part of what this all means, being female has nothing to do with it. I love football. I love football. I love teaching. I love these kids. Promo .

TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today\\'s Shoutout goes out to Mr. Struna\\'s U.S. history classes at Stone Middle School in Melbourne, Florida! You may know that the first 3 digits of pi are 3.14. What is the fourth digit? Is it: A) 1, B) 3, C) 5 or D) 7? You\\'ve got three seconds -- GO! 3.1415926... and so on, is the more expanded number. That\\'s your answer and that\\'s your Shoutout! Education the World . AZUZ: Pi is irrational. Celebrating pi? Maybe a little odd. Celebrating pi by eating pie? Now you\\'re talking! That is just one way that people participate in Pi Day. March 14th. 3.14. That\\'s why. The holiday has been gaining steam recently as people around the world pay homage to pi on Pi Day. We don\\'t know whether Sal Kahn did anything special yesterday. What we do know is that Mr. Kahn has a gift for numbers, and he\\'s sharing that gift with the world. Dan Simon explains how. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT, SAN FRANCISCO: Sal Khan lives in California outside of San Francisco. Sara Shadid, halfway around the globe in Dubai. Their lives are interconnected, but Khan doesn\\'t know it. This is a story about how one man is helping to educate the world, but has never seen any of his students face-to-face. Where does this passion come from? SALMAN KHAN, YOUTUBE CALCULUS TEACHER: You know, I think I have always enjoyed teaching. SIMON: It is about a man who gave up a lucrative career in Silicon Valley for what might look like a boring desk job. KHAN: Right now, I\\'m cash-flow negative. SIMON: But it was never about money. And with his drive and education, Khan could have made millions. He was valedictorian of his high school with a perfect math score on the SAT. Then came MIT; Bill Clinton handing him his diploma. Next, Harvard Business School. He was lured into hedge funds and did well. But Khan, who has a wife and son to support, gave it up. KHAN: A lot of people thought I was kind of crazy. Obviously, you know, when every waking hour you have, you would sneak into a room and make math videos and put them on YouTube, people kind of questioned what\\'s up. SIMON: Here is what is up: Khan\\'s YouTube videos. KHAN: Let\\'s do a couple more examples and I think you might get it. KHAN: They have been clicked on more than nine million times from users around the world. The topics range from math to chemistry to economics. SARA SHADID, CALCULUS STUDENT: From every curriculum, we can use the videos. He\\'s really helpful. SIMON: One of his users: 19-year-old college sophomore Sara Shadid in Dubai. She says that the videos made all of the difference in helping her conquer calculus. This gigantic virtual school originates from the smallest of places, from a tiny converted closet inside Sal\\'s master bedroom. This is where he is able to reach an estimated 80,000 knowledge-seeking users a month. It all started a few years ago when a cousin wanted some online math tutoring. Pretty soon, other relatives started asking for similar help. Suddenly, people he didn\\'t know started watching. It is now called the Khan Academy. The videos are short and simply produced; only his voice with a simple black background and graphics. KHAN: There are a lot of people who need help with their math, science, whatever. And I think they find these YouTube videos as kind of the ideal nuggets to fill in their gaps. SIMON: Whatever you call him or his teachings, the success of his site has validated that decision to walk away from hedge funds. Dan Simon, CNN, San Francisco. (END VIDEO) River Going Green . AZUZ: The Chicago River is going green! It has nothing to do with envy or the environment. This switch in shade is all about St. Patrick\\'s Day! Every year since 1962, Chicago residents have come out to watch the city\\'s river get a dye job. Organizers say the bright green color only lasts about five hours nowadays. When the event started back in \\'62, the river stayed green for five days. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, we have another story about waiting for nature to run its course. ROBERT ROSIN, JEWELRY STORE OWNER: And you saw Soli go for the diamond. Gobbled it up. Tried to pull it out of his mouth. Couldn\\'t get it. Gone. AZUZ: This is Soli. And that diamond he gobbled up is worth $20,000! The vet said the only thing to do was wait for the diamond to reappear. After three days of hand wringing and probably a lot of hand washing... Goodbye . AZUZ: ...Everything came out all right in the end. That story is just flush with pun-tential. But we will keep it clean. For CNN Student News, I\\'m Carl Azuz.',\n",

With a little help from her affair with newly-appointed Manchester United manager, Ryan Giggs, a stint on Big Brother and a LOT of lingerie shoots, Imogen Thomas became one of the most sought-after glamour girls of the decade. But the Welsh beauty queen and former reality TV star says she has 'hung up' her lingerie to focus on motherhood. Speaking to MailOnline, the mother-of-one said: 'I used to be desperate for magazine shoots, I was really enjoying it and while I've always got offers coming in, now I'm 31, it's time to hang up the lingerie.' Scroll down for video . New figure: Imogen Thomas, who found fame as a glamour model and star of Big Brother, has dropped a dress size and is keen to show off the results of her efforts . Drop a dress size: Imogen, 31, who had a baby last February, says she put on weight by snacking (right) but has since slimmed down to a size 10 (left) thanks to exercising and natural supplements . Imogen, who had her first child with Australian boyfriend Adam Horsley last February, says that while she had a 'good run', she is enjoying motherhood so much that she's 'letting the young girls' take care of the lingerie modelling now. One part of having baby Ariana that Imogen didn't enjoy was putting on weight - and she's found it incredibly hard to shift. 'I was snacking on Ariana's food when we ate out. She would have two chips and I'd eat the rest. As all new mothers will know, it's so hard to lose weight, especially that stubborn part of your stomach.' she said. Imogen - who went up to a size 12 after having her daughter - has been on a health kick and is now back at a size 10. 'I was really unhappy with that little pouch on my stomach so I have been eating healthily, exercising a lot and taking Nature's Way African Mango seed extract, which claims to target fat cell growth and help increase the breakdown of fats. 'It stops me snacking and just gives me that oomph in the morning. I also love trampolining, it's amazing for weight loss. I go to spin class and some days I dread it but always feel great after,' she said. Imogen reveals that she's lucky enough not to have any stretch marks - probably thanks to her 'obsession' with skincare, which sees her scrubbing her skin for twenty minutes every single day. Healthy and happy: Imogen says that after she had Ariana, she would snack on her leftover food (right) but thanks to her new health kick, she finally feels beach ready (left) Family: Imogen, who had her first child Ariana with Australian boyfriend Adam Horsley last February, says that while she had a 'good run' at lingerie modelling, she is enjoying motherhood too much to go back to it now . Thanks to her new fitness and beauty regime, Imogen says she finally feels body confident. 'I want to feel good on the poolside this summer and I definitely feel bikini-ready now. I can't wait to show off the results on my next holiday,' she said. As for her diet, Imogen says she never deprives herself and instead swaps her favourite treats for healthy alternatives. 'I love sweet potatoes, but I also have the occasional helping of strawberries dipped in dark chocolate - I don't know how people can cut out treats completely.' As well as focussing on her new health regime, Imogen says she's put work projects on hold to have some 'me time', hang out with her family and focus on redecorating their house. Showing off: Imogen shows off her svelte new frame at the Pure Rally launch outside The Mayfair Hotel today . Pretty in pink: Imogen was one of the first punters to take a ride in the swanky new Lamborghini cab . Hard at work: The mother-of-one showcased the rather impressive fruits of her labour in a form-fitting salmon shirt and black skinny jeans . Finding fame: Imogen, aged 23, was a contestant in the seventh series of the Channel 4 reality show Big Brother .\",\n",

James Mattis -- if he wins presidential and Senate approval -- will move from being the outgoing commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command to leading the U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. The command also monitors Iran. He would take over the post left open by the departure of Gen. David Petraeus, who was asked to take over command of the war in Afghanistan. Mattis was an effective leader in the Marine Corps, in the eyes of the Pentagon, while commanding troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Known for his straight talk and hard-core leadership of Marines in the 2004 battle of Falluja, Iraq, Mattis is considered a dark-horse pick by many in the halls of the Pentagon. His blunt talk has gotten him in trouble: In 2005 he said, \"It\\'s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them,\" referring to Afghan fighters. Asked if the general would be an effective leader for the Central Command region with the shadow of the comments still lingering, Gates said Thursday, \"Appropriate action was taken at the time. I think that the subsequent five years have demonstrated that the lesson was learned.\" \"Obviously, in the wake of the Rolling Stone interview, we discussed this kind of thing. And I have every confidence that General Mattis will respond to questions and speak publicly about the matters for which he is responsible in an entirely appropriate way,\" Gates said. The Rolling Stone interview led to the resignation of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, then the commander in Afghanistan, because of negative comments about Obama administration officials made by him and his aides. Mattis\\' comment in 2005 was made when the then-three-star general was in a panel discussion before an audience. \"Actually, it\\'s quite fun to fight them, you know. It\\'s a hell of a hoot,\" he said, prompting laughter from some military members in the audience. \"It\\'s fun to shoot some people. I\\'ll be right up there with you. I like brawling,\" he said. \"You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn\\'t wear a veil,\" he said. \"You know, guys like that ain\\'t got no manhood left anyway. So it\\'s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.\" The commandant of the Marine Corps at the time, Gen. Michael Hagee, counseled Mattis about the remarks but defended him publicly, calling him \"one of this country\\'s bravest and most experienced military leaders.\" \"While I understand that some people may take issue with the comments made by him, I also know he intended to reflect the unfortunate and harsh realities of war,\" he said in a written statement. \"Lt. Gen. Mattis often speaks with a great deal of candor.\" Mattis also was the commanding general overseeing the case of the now-infamous slayings of civilians by Marines in Haditha, Iraq. Some 24 civilians were killed on November 19, 2005, in what a human rights group and military prosecutors said was a house-to-house rampage by Marines after a roadside bomb killed one of their comrades. Eight Marines were charged, and all but one were cleared, some of them by Mattis. Mattis also was the overseeing authority in the murder case involving eight Marines found guilty of taking part in a plot to drag an Iraqi man from his home, kill him and then make it look like the man was an insurgent. That incident occurred near the western Iraqi town of Hamdania in April 2006. Mattis later cut the sentences of at least two of the Marines involved in the plot. Mattis had been preparing to retire after finishing his latest command, Gates said. \"General Mattis is one of our military\\'s outstanding combat leaders and strategic thinkers, bringing an essential mix of experience, judgment and perspective to this important post,\" Gates said. \"General Mattis has proven to be one of the military\\'s most innovative and iconoclastic thinkers. His insights into the nature of warfare in the 21st century have influenced my own views about how the armed forces must be shaped and postured for the future.\"',\n",

In 2005, he made controversial comments about the enjoyment of combat, which led to counseling from the Marine Corps commandant. Despite this, he has been praised for his strategic thinking and combat leadership. Mattis was also involved in overseeing high-profile cases, including the Haditha civilian killings and the Hamdania murder plot, where he reduced sentences for some of the Marines involved. Defense Secretary Robert Gates expressed confidence in Mattis's ability to handle the responsibilities of the new position, emphasizing his experience and innovative approach to modern warfare.\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'Fallujah and Ramadi may have been sites of heavy bloodshed in recent days, but the Sunni Muslims of Iraq\\'s Anbar Province, where the two cities are located, have long held a contemptuous attitude towards the embattled government of Prime Minister (and Shia Muslim) Nuri al-Maliki. Iraqi politics and many aspects of economic and social affairs have come to be dominated by antagonistic relationships between the country\\'s Sunni and Shia populations. Nowhere is that more evident than in Anbar. For all intents and purposes, Fallujah and Ramadi are now out of the control of the central government and are now ruled under the authority, to differing degrees, of Sunni militiamen, local (tribally influenced) police, and extremist militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. READ MORE: Maliki demands Fallujah expel \"terrorists\" Having already launched a substantial military offensive targeting ISIS in Anbar\\'s desert terrain on December 23, the Iraqi Army has now shifted much of its attention towards securing the province\\'s key towns and cities. Arresting Ahmed al-Alwani, a powerful Sunni MP from Ramadi -- and killing his brother Ali -- on December 28 enraged the people of Anbar. But the coordinated military operation to shut down the city\\'s expansive anti-government protest camp two days later was simply one move too far. Most tribes issued calls to arms and demanded the withdrawal of all federal armed forces from the province. Heavy fighting soon followed, the army withdrew personnel from all cities, and the convoys of heavily armed ISIS militants streamed into Ramadi and Fallujah, where security resistance was quickly subdued. As things stand today, the army stands poised to launch a major assault on Fallujah, where ISIS militants and local tribesmen are now the predominant force. Meanwhile in Ramadi, Sunni tribesmen -- particularly from the Albu Bali and the Al-Ghanim tribes -- have taken a more pragmatic approach and cooperated with local security forces in limited operations against ISIS militants. READ MORE: 5 things to know about Iraq crisis . Iraqi security was in dire straits well before the outbreak of deadly violence in Anbar. 2013 has been the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008. Much of this can be attributed to ISIS\\' rapid escalation of operations in Iraq, which has undoubtedly been aided by its expansion into Syria\\'s civil conflict in April 2013. And with Iraqi elections scheduled to take place in April, Prime Minister Maliki is likely feeling pressure to present a strongman image, particularly to his core Shia constituents. At times in recent months, Maliki has adopted sharply sectarian rhetoric when referring to Sunni elements opposed to his government and has often presented the Sunni protest movement (including the Ramadi camp) as inherently connected to al Qaeda. With no substantive evidence to back these claims, it increasingly appeared that \"al Qaeda\" was being used as a political tool. This is not in any way to suggest ISIS (a structure that in fact ceased to officially be \"al Qaeda\" in 2007) does not pose a threat; quite the contrary. But tribes wield great influence in Anbar, and their dominant position within local security forces -- particularly the police -- meant ISIS had previously been restricted to an existence in the desert. Ironically, it was probably Maliki\\'s crackdown on the Ramadi protest camp and the botched arrest of Ahmed al-Alwani that created the conditions for ISIS militants to move into the cities. But they\\'re not the only force on the ground. In Fallujah, defected local police personnel and armed tribesmen opposed to the federal government arguably represent the superior force. For Maliki, neutralizing the protest movement before the elections was of paramount importance. Exploiting the threat of ISIS in order to exert military authority over the heavily tribal Sunni heartland of Anbar was a bold move. And the deployment of large numbers of army personnel from the predominantly Shia provinces of Maysan, Dhi Qar and Basra underlines the need to bring fiercely loyal forces into what will inevitably become a bloody fight. READ MORE: Tribesmen join in fight against al Qaeda . Fallujah now looks set to be the major flashpoint. While the military assault on the city has been temporarily suspended to allow for tribal negotiations to take place, at least some measure of military assault appears inevitable. It is likely the army will employ air strikes, artillery and mortar fire in preparation for a ground assault. Unfortunately, such tactics tend to incur heavy civilian casualties, which will only fuel greater anti-government sentiment and encourage tribal hostility. As U.S. and coalition forces discovered to their grave dismay in 2004, a siege of Fallujah won\\'t end in days or weeks. Given the inherently social-level aspect of the tribal opposition to Maliki\\'s government and the complexity of defeating any insurgent group in an urban environment, army forces will likely be deployed in and around Anbar\\'s urban centers for some time to come -- risking prolonging tensions even further in the process. Considering the overwhelming attention given to the role of ISIS role in this grim state of affairs, it is unsurprising that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has pledged to support Maliki\\'s offensive in Anbar -- albeit not with troops on the ground. The U.S. sent 75 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles to the Iraqi military in December and has pledged to accelerate the sale of a further 100 this spring. U.S. ScanEagle and Raven reconnaissance drones are also set to bolster the army\\'s capability to combat terrorism. This may be a reasonable policy on paper, but when placed within recent geopolitical dynamics in the region it risks bolstering the widespread perception within the Middle East\\'s Sunni communities that the U.S. has recently undertaken a fundamental policy shift -- now aligning with Shia powers at the expense of Sunni ones. The September 14 deal agreed between the U.S. and Russia on Syria\\'s chemical weapons -- not to mention the interim nuclear deal the U.S. signed with Iran two months later -- has damaged U.S. relations with Gulf states and weakened U.S. relations with all sectors of Syria\\'s opposition. The provision of sophisticated military equipment to the ultimately Shia-commanded Iraqi military, which is deploying Shia loyalist forces into a hostile Sunni tribal environment, risks further consolidating this emerging interpretation of international geopolitics. Maliki may be heartened by an Iranian offer to provide military equipment and advisory support in Anbar -- a politically astute move by Iran -- but it certainly won\\'t help the U.S. dispel the perception that it has to some degree switched sides. For Maliki and Iraq, ISIS remains an extremely concerning problem. ISIS has now established an urban presence in Anbar -- particularly in Fallujah and, to a lesser extent, in Ramadi -- that must be overthrown. In this situation, and indeed in many in the Middle East, the tribes will play the role of kingmakers, and for those who have not already pragmatically sided with federal authorities, Maliki must change the perception in Anbar that he -- and not ISIS -- is their bigger enemy. Crucially, local -- and not federal -- security forces enjoy productive structural links with the tribes, and should form the backbone of any urban fighting force in Anbar -- as already appears to be case in areas of Ramadi. If the army launches an all-out offensive on Fallujah, ISIS will likely be the main benefactor. Ten years ago, the U.S. military led two major offensives on militants in Fallujah. While the actors may have changed or evolved since, history appears to be repeating itself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Lister.',\n",

The Sunni-majority Anbar Province has long been at odds with the Shia-led government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The situation escalated in December 2013 when the Iraqi Army, under Maliki's orders, launched a military offensive against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and arrested a prominent Sunni MP, Ahmed al-Alwani, leading to widespread anger and armed resistance.\\n\\nISIS militants, along with local Sunni tribes and defected police, have taken control of Fallujah and parts of Ramadi. The Iraqi Army, predominantly composed of Shia forces, is preparing for a major assault on Fallujah, where ISIS and local tribes are the dominant forces. In Ramadi, some tribes have cooperated with local security forces to combat ISIS, but the overall situation remains volatile.\\n\\nThe conflict has been exacerbated by Maliki's sectarian rhetoric and the perception that he is using the threat of ISIS to exert control over Sunni areas. The U.S. has pledged support to Maliki, including military aid, but this has raised concerns among Sunni communities about a perceived shift\",\n",

Aisha made headlines and was on a recent cover of Time magazine, showing the plight of women in Afghanistan. \"When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out,\" Aisha said, describing the attack. \"It felt like there was cold water in my nose. I opened my eyes, and I couldn\\'t even see because of all the blood.\" But she survived. With the help of an American provincial reconstruction team in Oruzgan province and the organization Women for Afghan Women, she finally received the help and protection she needed. And now she is on her way to the United States, where the Grossman Burn Foundation will provide her with reconstructive surgery and a new life. Read a behind-the-scenes with Aisha then and now . Aisha says her mutilation was an act of Taliban justice for the crime of shaming her husband\\'s family. At 16, she was handed over to her husband\\'s father and 10 brothers, who she claims were all members of the Taliban in Oruzgan. \"I spent two years with them and became a prisoner,\" she said. Read more about Aisha\\'s story . She eventually ran away but was caught by police in Kandahar. And although running away is not a crime, in places throughout Afghanistan, it is treated as one if you are a woman. Eventually her father-in-law found her and took her back to her abusive home. She was taken to a Taliban court for dishonoring her husband\\'s family and bringing them shame. The court ruled that her nose and ears must be cut off, an act carried out by her husband in the mountains of Oruzgan, where they left her to die. After Aisha\\'s story was exposed to the world through various news organizations, offers of help poured in. But there are many more women still suffering. The United Nations estimates that nearly 90 percent of Afghanistan\\'s women face some sort of domestic abuse. This in a country where there are fewer than a dozen women\\'s shelters providing sanctuary from the cruelty they face. And all of them are privately run. \"Bibi Aisha is only one example of thousands of girls and women in Afghanistan and throughout the world who are treated this way. Who suffer abuses like this -- like this and worse,\" Women for Afghan Women board member Esther Hyneman said. In 2001, the situation of Afghan women and Taliban brutality received lots of attention. Now, organizations like Women for Afghan Women say, the international community is strangely silent on the issue. And with the Afghan government\\'s plans to negotiate with some of the Taliban -- supported by many in the international community -- many fear that it will be the women who will pay the price. Hyneman says that not enough is being done to help the women in Afghanistan, and that feeds into the hands of the Taliban. Aisha is reminded of that every time she looks in the mirror. But at least now she will be going to the United States for a chance at a new life. And just like the iconic picture of an Afghan girl on a 1985 National Geographic cover brought the plight of Afghan women under Soviet oppression to the world\\'s attention, many hope Aisha\\'s face can show the new plight under the Taliban.',\n",

A mother-of two who says she still looked pregnant a year after giving birth has lost three stone in four months - thanks to raspberry diet pills. Amy Middleton, 34, dreaded having to get dressed up after giving birth to her second child. She'd had no problem getting back to a size 10 after the birth of her first child, Archie, three years ago. But after having her daughter Hattie 18 months later, her 'mummy tummy' simply wouldn't shift. Instead, she remained at her peak weight of 13 stone for more than a year, despite trips to the gym three times a week. She believes she was a victim of . ‘second baby syndrome’ whereby it is far harder to shift excess fat from . the abdomen because a woman’s stomach muscles are weakened by the . rigours of giving birth in quick succession. Amy, who lives with her husband Tom and children in Southwick, near Brighton, said: ‘I had two children quite quickly. ‘I . had always prided myself on staying in shape and having a great figure . but after the second birth there was nothing I could do to shift my . mummy tummy. ‘My stomach muscles just weren’t . the same – I just didn’t have the power there to keep all the excess fat . tucked up. It was classic “second baby syndrome.” ‘I think your body changes so much by having children so quickly together.’ Mrs Middleton lost three stone in four months while taking the Forza Raspberry Ketone diet pills . She added: ‘It was also hard to be really disciplined when I had two small kids to look after. ‘I would be snacking quite a bit during the day because there wasn’t time always to eat healthily. ‘My stomach was still protruding and I . was not at all happy with my figure. I couldn’t bear to go on nights . out because I feared someone at a bar or club would say, “When is the . baby due?” – even though I’d given birth nearly a year before. ‘All my friends would still be wearing their tight going-out clothes and I was wearing loose baggy tops to cover my tummy. ‘I didn’t feel sexy at all. I started to get really depressed and feared that I might not ever get my figure back again.’ Amy had read about how Kim Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey had both used Raspberry Ketone diet pills to keep in shape in the U.S. Raspberry ketones are fragrant compounds that occur naturally in raspberries and a number of other fruits. Before taking the pills (left) Amy dreaded going out in case people thought she was still pregnant. Now (right), she is confident enough to pose in a bikini . After taking the pills Amy felt sufficiently confident to wear a bikini while on a family holiday in Egypt . They were hailed as a ‘miracle’ diet cure after being featured on the popular U.S. medical show Dr Oz – and immediately sold out across the U.S. and Canada. They are said to work by suppressing the appetite and giving users an energy rush through caffeine which increases resting metabolism - allowing users to burn more calories even when they are not exercising. It is believed the pills may also boost levels of a hormone called adiponectin, which regulates metabolism. Higher levels of this hormone are associated with fewer fat stores. Amy, who took Forza Raspberry Ketones, claims they had an immediate effect and within four months of taking them she had shifted her dreaded ‘mummy tummy’ and lost three stone in weight. She went down from 13 stone to her current weight of ten stone and switched from a size 14\\xa0 to size 10. Her waist measurement shrunk from 34 inches to 30. She was so proud of her new figure that she posed in her favourite bikinis a few weeks later. She says she now feels like a 'completely new woman'. I don’t have to worry about anyone asking if I am still pregnant!,' she said. Despite going to the gym three times a week, Amy struggled to shift her 'mummy tummy' after the birth of Hattie (pictured) She added: ‘There is no doubt that the pills made all the difference. I had tried everything to shift my “mummy tummy” and at one point was going to the gym three times a week.' ‘But it was so difficult to diet and bring up the kids properly at the same time and I need a bit of extra help. ‘The pills only work really effectively if you combine them with exercise and a good diet – but they give me the impetus to get all elements of my life into order. ‘I don’t drink tea or coffee so I would really notice the energy boost when I took them. It was nothing strong – just a little pep up. 'But it was especially what I needed – particularly in the afternoons which were the time of day when I would have starting snacking.’ Amy’s confidence surged as she got back to her ideal weight. She explained: ‘I was losing around 4lbs a week. The weight just steadily came off and after four months I had shed three stone and all my excessive baby weight. My dreaded “mummy tummy” had gone. It is believed that Raspberry Ketone pills boost levels of a hormone called adiponectin, which regulates metabolism . ‘It was so great to have my flat . stomach back. I was confident enough to wear my tiny spaghetti strap . bikini on holiday in Egypt this Christmas.’ Amy, a self-employed business manager, is still not being complacent. She . said: ‘Now that I am close to my target weight I am still taking one . Raspberry Ketone a day. It helps to keep everything on an even keel.’ Her husband Tom, a regional manager with a firm of estate agents, is thrilled that his wife has all her old zip back. Amy said: 'I’m back wearing all my old tight tops on my nights out with the girls.'\",\n",

If becoming old is something that you can't get your head around, there could be a good reason why. Researchers have discovered a phenomenon called ‘the end of history illusion’ in which we mistakenly think we are always the finished article. A survey of 19,000 people found that when we look back in hindsight it easy to see how much we have changed. But we look into the future, however, we are rarely able to see how different we are going to be. The finding helps to explain why a teenager who gets a tattoo never thinks they will regret it, even if they do so later. Similarly, when we get older the prospect of grey hair is not something we can begin to imagine. The researchers asked the 19,000 respondents 18 to 68 to take a survey and asked about their values, personalities and things they liked to do. Some were asked to reflect back over the last 10 years whilst others were asked to predict how they would change in the coming decade. The American team found that across all age ranges, everyone underestimated how much they would be different in the future. When it came to music for example, most people expected artists like Coldplay or Rhianna to play on into their old age - even though they will by then long have stopped making music. Lead researcher Daniel Gilbert, a psychologist at Harvard University, said that the findings showed that a 40-year-old looking back would remember more looking back than a 30-year-old would looking forward. He said: ‘What we never seem to realize is that our future selves will look back and think the very same thing about us. Phenomenon: Many of the 19,000 people questioned by researchers at Harvard University couldn't imagine their appearance changing or getting grey hair as they got older (stock image) ‘At every age we think we’re having the last laugh, and at every age we’re wrong. ‘Life is a process of growing and changing, and what our results suggest is that growth and change really never stops, despite the fact that at every age from 18 to 68, we think it's pretty much come to a close.’ Jordi Quoidbach of Harvard University, another one of the researchers, added: ‘Believing that we just reached the peak of our personal evolution makes us feel good. ‘The ‘I wish that I knew then what I know now’ experience might give us a sense of satisfaction and meaning, whereas realising how transient our preferences and values are might lead us to doubt every decision and generate anxiety.’\",\n",

This illusion helps explain why teenagers might not regret getting tattoos, even if they do later, and why older adults have difficulty imagining changes like grey hair. The study revealed that across all age groups, participants underestimated how their values, personalities, and preferences would evolve over the next decade. For instance, many expected to continue enjoying the same music, even as artists like Coldplay or Rihanna would likely stop producing new music. Lead researcher Daniel Gilbert noted that this phenomenon persists at every age, with people consistently believing they have reached their peak of personal evolution, only to be proven wrong as they continue to grow and change. Co-researcher Jordi Quoidbach added that this belief can provide a sense of satisfaction and meaning, but it can also lead to anxiety if one realizes how transient personal preferences and values can be.',\n",

The defending champion triumphed 7-5 6-3 in one hour and 25 minutes to set up a ATP World Tour Finals showdown with sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Sunday. He extended his winning record against the fifth-seeded Spaniard to 12-0 in career meetings, and is now unbeaten in 16 matches after winning titles in his hometown Basel and Paris in the past month. The 30-year-old now has the chance to surpass Ivan Lendl and Pete Sampras, who won the tournament five times in the 1980s and \\'90s respectively. Djokovic exits as Berdych beats Ferrer at ATP Tour Finals . \"It\\'s obviously a special occasion for me tomorrow playing my 100th final, possibly winning my 70th title and winning my sixth at the World Tour Finals,\" Federer said. \"It was a tough match. I could clearly see why David beat Murray and Djokovic here -- he takes the ball really early, is able to generate great angles off his plays and is super consistent. \"It was a key 5-4 game for me to hold and then break the next game. Then, actually, break again early on in the second set. That was a crucial sort of 15-20 minutes for me. I\\'m happy I was able to decide the match right there.\" Ferrer will now turn his attentions to the Davis Cup final, as Spain take on Argentina in Seville on his more favored clay surface next weekend. He started the week with a bang, beating Andy Murray in straight sets before the third-seeded Briton pulled out with a groin injury. Ferrer then thrashed world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, but suffered a surprise defeat to Berdych on Friday that meant the Czech went through as Group A winner and avoided Ferrer in the semis. Federer, who beat Rafael Nadal in last year\\'s final, has reached the title match for the seventh time after winning all four matches this week at the indoor hard-court event. Tsonga continued his strong end to the season with a 6-3 7-5 win over seventh seed Berdych in Saturday\\'s second semi.

Looking back at the days leading up to the fatal July 20 movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, it appears now that there were ignored warning signs that could have saved many lives. Psychiatrist Dr Lynne Fenton who counseled shooter James Holmes reportedly tried to discuss her worries about his mental condition with University of Colorado staff and at least one campus police officer in early June. On June 10, the once-promising graduate student dropped out of the school, and the university officials who were aware of Dr. Fenton's concerns apparently felt they could no longer do anything to follow the issue as he was no longer under their jurisdiction. Little did they know that Holmes bought his first assault weapon just three days before leaving the school. Concerns: Dr Lynne Fenton (left) called University of Colorado security staff about student James Holmes . Nightline reports that while Dr. Fenton- who is a member of the . campus behavior evaluation and . threat assessment team herself- notified an unspecified number of other . members, the entire group never convened to discuss the threat posed by . Holmes because he had already left the university. Said group was created to address behavioral problems as well as potential security issues involving students and was composed of faculty and staff, including campus . police. Fenton . could not be immediately reached for comment. Members of the university . did not immediately return telephone messages seeking comment. The doctor has since been questioned by Colorado police as a part of the investigation into the shooting which left 12 dead and 58 injured. A lawyer was present for the meeting. Holmes' attorneys filed a motion that revealed Holmes was seeing the psychiatrist. The . revelation raised questions about Holmes' year of study at the . university's medical campus and about possible motives behind the . shooting. An online resumé listed schizophrenia as one of Dr Fenton's research interests. Who knew what: University of Colorado police chief Doug Abraham answered questions at a news conference just days after the attack but the details of the chain of command have still been kept quiet . Threats: On the same day as the press conference, police were called to the school because a suspicious package was found on the campus . The . defense motion demanded that a package allegedly sent to Dr Fenton by . Holmes, and received at the university after the shooting, be kept . sealed because of doctor-patient confidentiality. It also demanded information on who may have leaked information about . its contents to some news media outlets that reported that Holmes had . written descriptions of an attack in a notebook.

              "  {'content': 'The Pro Football Hall of Fame is about to get a lot bigger. The hall\\'s selection committee on Saturday -- meeting in New Orleans, on the eve of Super Bowl XLVII -- selected six former players and one coach to join the ranks of the NFL\\'s best. They were all bigger than life, literally and figuratively, in their heydays -- from towering, 6-foot-9 inch Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden to the \"Big Tuna,\" the moniker given to legendary and well-traveled coach Bill Parcells. \"Surreal. Speechless,\" Ogden said, on his Twitter page, moments after the announcement. \"Still can\\'t believe it.\" The original Raven -- as the team\\'s first draft pick after it relocated from Cleveland to Baltimore -- literally stands above everyone else in the Class of 2013, by virtue of his height and 345-pound frame. On the field, the UCLA grad stood out enough to be named All-Pro six times and earn Pro Bowl honors in 11 of his 12 seasons. Another big name, and big personality, who will be joining him is Warren Sapp. The University of Miami product terrorized linemen and quarterbacks while racking up 96.5 sacks over his 13-year career with the Oakland Raiders and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, although some better know him for his brash trash-talking, wide smile and love for the camera, including on the 2008 season of \"Dancing With the Stars.\" \"Warren played the game with incredible ability and passion,\" Buccaneers co-chairman Bryan Glazer said of the 1999 Defensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl XXXVII champ. \"He ... helped to redefine the tackle position.\" Two other defensive stars will be joining Sapp in the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. One is another defensive tackle, Curley Culp, who made six Pro Bowls during his 14 seasons between 1968 and 1981 with the Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Oilers and Detroit Lions. Going farther back in NFL history is linebacker Dave Robinson, who amassed 27 interceptions in his career, much of it with Vince Lombardi\\'s great Green Bay Packer teams. After narrowly missing out in recent years, wide receiver Cris Carter finally will make the trip to Canton -- just 120 miles from where he first emerged at Ohio State University. In his 16 NFL campaigns, most of them with the Minnesota Vikings, he was consistently among the league\\'s top wideouts with eight straight seasons with over 1,000 receiving yards and 130 total touchdowns. His selection stirred rejoicing among Vikings\\' fans, with team owner Zygi Wilf calling the current ESPN analyst \"one of the most beloved players in franchise history.\" \"In terms of catching the football, I haven\\'t seen anybody in my time better than Cris Carter,\" former Vikings assistant and Indianapolis Colts head coach Tony Dungy said, according to the Vikings\\' official website. Just over five years ago, Larry Allen was a dominating presence with the San Francisco 49ers, with whom he played after 12 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. Now the mammoth offensive lineman -- measuring in at 6 feet, 3 inches and 325 pounds -- has another honor to his name as a hall of famer, in addition to having been named to the NFL\\'s All-Decade teams for the 1990s and 2000s. \"Larry is one of the greatest players in Cowboys history, and arguably the very best guard to ever play the game,\" said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, whom Allen has tapped to give his induction speech. Parcells is this year\\'s other honoree, a man who never played in the NFL though he nonetheless became one of the league\\'s most recognizable names in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. A graduate of Wichita State University, he was drafted in the seventh round by the Detroit Lions but opted for a carer in coaching. He took stints at several universities before jumping to the NFL. Parcells led the New York Giants to two Super Bowl titles, then took the New England Patriots to the title game in January 1997 (where they lost), before finishing up his career with stops with the New York Jets, Cowboys and Miami Dolphins. \"Bill Parcells has been thought of as one of the all-time greats for a long time, so it is with great pride that we can officially refer to him as a Hall of Famer,\" said Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, who coached under Parcells with the Giants and Jets before succeeding him in New England. \"He deserves all the recognition he is getting.\" The seven inductees were chosen Saturday by the Pro Football Hall of Fame\\'s selection committee from a list of 17 finalists -- with late longtime Cleveland Browns and Ravens owner Art Modell, Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome Bettis and wide receiver Tim Brown among those narrowly missing the cut. The honorees will be enshrined on August 3, in a ceremony expected to include 130 others who have been so honored over the past 50 years. Already blown away by his name being called, Ogden said he expects the feeling will only get better when he gets to Ohio, according to a story on the Ravens\\' official website. \"It will be one of the best moments of my life,\" he said.',\n",

              "  {'content': \"Apple's iPhone could soon replace your ID card and subway card as well as your credit card, it has been revealed. The firm last week launched Apple Pay, which allows\\xa0people\\xa0to pay by tapping their phone and using a\\xa0fingerprint on its home button to identify themselves. Now it is believed to be in talks to open up the technology to other uses. Scroll down for video . Obstacles: Apple Pay lets users pay with their phones at some 200,000 retail stores. Consumers may use whatever credit cards they'd like. While the system appears seamless, retailer opposition is a serious hurdle for the Silicon Valley giant . Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch. The mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. According to the report in\\xa0The Information, Apple's is planning to replace transit cards, like the ones that the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago subway and train systems use. 'The Apple representatives have talked to technology providers like HID Global and Cubic, which enable secure access to buildings and transit fare systems, respectively,' people briefed on the discussions told The Information. 'Spokespeople for the companies declined to comment about any discussions with Apple, but executives there discussed how they could integrate their systems with the iPhone.' Apple has already announced one partnership along these lines with Starwood Hotels, which allows visitors to use an Apple Watch instead of a keycard, but this will employ Bluetooth technology rather than NFC. However, Apple Pay has not been without its issues. CVS and Rite Aid have joined a long list of the world's largest retailers who will not be accepting Apple Pay. At its launch, Apple boasted there are 200,000 retail stores now ready and willing to let you give them your cash using just a flick of your iPhone and a tap of your finger to prove your identity. But retail giants Walmart, Target, Kohl's. Dunkin' Donuts are not among them. These retail giants and dozens more are part of a group developing their own mobile payment scheme. When the App;e watch hits stores in 2015, the Starwood Hotels app will allow guests to unlock their hotel room doors without having to fumble with a key or dig through a bag to find a key card. The app was featured during Apple’s unveiling earlier this year and it will be used at some of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide’s properties, which include the Westin, Sheraton, W and Aloft brands, starting next spring. Apps that unlock hotel room doors are the wave of the future as hotel and travel companies attempt to make holidays more convenient. Hilton Hotels has also announced plans to replace keys with smartphones. American Airlines is partnering with the tech giant to create an Apple Watch app that will allow travellers to manage their bookings. Starwood recently made headlines when it announced that it would be using a robot butler at its Aloft boutique hotel in California’s Silicon Valley. Known as the Botlr, the robotic bellhop is designed to ferry amenities from the front desk to any of the hotel’s 150 rooms in just three minutes or less. It comes after the system hit several glitches following its launch last week. Some Apple Pay users in the US have been double-charged for purchases. The Californian tech giant has admitted there is a problem with its mobile payment system, but says it only affected 'a very small number' of Apple Pay users with Bank of America accounte, and is working to refund all faulty transactions. CVS and Rite Aid initially accepted Apple Pay, but quickly turned heel and no longer take the payment system. The chains disabled the system in their stores over the weekend, reports the\\xa0New York Times. The retailer group to which both companies belong, the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), is creating CurrentC--a system similar to Apple Pay that will be owned by a consortium of retailers rather than a third party, i.e. Apple. Apple Pay (screenshots pictured above) stores Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit card information and works with the iPhone 6's touch ID fingerprint recognition system so users can touch their phone on a contactless reader to pay for goods. Stores such as McDonalds, Macy's and Walgreensare involved . The Merchant Customer Exchange, a consortium of retailers creating their own mobile payment app, includes dozens of companies, many of which are among America's largest retailers: . Best Buy, Lowe's, Kmart, Kohl's, Dunkin' Donuts, Gap, Sam's, Walmart, Target, Wendy's, 7-Eleven, Exxon, Publix, Shell, Sheetz, Shop-Rite, Conoco, Wawa, Dick's, Olive Garden and more. Like Apple Pay, CurrentC allows consumers to quickly and securely pay for goods and services with the aid of an app on their cell phones. CurrentC, however, appears to work in an opposite way from Apple Pay. While the former uses what's called an NFC chip, which is scanned by the retail kiosk, the MCX system has the phone scan a code generated by the kiosk. Not only is CurrentC hoping to leave Apple out in the cold, it's trying to circumvent credit cards completely. While Apple Pay allows users to store whatever credit cards they'd like in their phones, CurrentC taps directly into the user's bank account. Results, though, are the same: a seamless and safe purchasing process. CurrentC is set to hit smartphones in 2015. Apple said it had found most retailers were enthusiastic. 'The feedback we are getting from customers and retailers about Apple Pay is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, it told Business Insider. 'We are working to get as many merchants as possible to support this convenient, secure and private payment option for consumers. 'Many retailers have already seen the benefits and are delighting their customers at over 220,000 locations. And that may be Apple's one advantage, it's pay system is already here. Apple Pay made its debut last week. Now you can flash your new iPhone in the checkout line to pay for food, clothing and other goods. There's no need to pull out your credit card. But don't leave your wallet or purse behind quite yet: Despite a few dozen retail chains pledging support for Apple Pay, so-called contactless payments are still new. Smaller merchants, in particular, aren't likely to have the necessary equipment right away. All told, there are more than 200,000 payment terminals that should accept Apple Pay in the U.S. Apple has announced about two dozen leading retail chains accepting Apple Pay at launch, and others are planning to do so by the end of the year. Apple said it has worked with several retailers to make sure most of their stores, if not all of them, were ready at Monday's launch: Aeropostale, American Eagle Outfitters, Babies R Us, BJ's Wholesale Club, Bloomingdale's, Champs Sports, Chevron and Texaco retail stores including ExtraMile, Disney Store, Duane Reade, Footaction, Foot Locker, House of Hoops by Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Macy's, McDonald's, Nike, Office Depot, Panera Bread, Petco, RadioShack, RUN by Foot Locker, SIX:02, Sports Authority, Subway, Toys R Us, Unleashed by Petco, Walgreens, Wegmans and Whole Foods Market. Bright side: Dozens of retailers will be accepting Apple Pay, the biggest of which include Subway, Whole Fooods, Walgreens, McDonald's and Macy's . Apple also said that the following merchants plan to add support by the end of the year: Anthropologie, Free People, Sephora, Staples, Urban Outfitters and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. For online payments, Apple said the following merchants have apps ready for Apple Pay: Chairish, Fancy, Groupon, HotelTonight, Houzz, Instacart, Lyft, OpenTable, Panera Bread, Spring, Staples, Target and Uber. Others expected by year's end include: Airbnb, Disney Store, Eventbrite, JackThreads, Levi's Stadium by VenueNext, Sephora, Starbucks, StubHub, Ticketmaster and Tickets.com. Of course, Apple's retail stores and the Apple Store app will also take Apple Pay. Apple Pay is designed to protect the user's personal information. It doesn't collect any transaction information that can be tied back to a user and payment transactions are between the user, the merchant and the user's bank. Apple doesn't collect its users' purchase history, so when they are shopping in a store or restaurant it doesn't know what they bought, where they bought it or how much they paid for it. Card numbers are not stored on the device, instead, a unique Device Account Number is created, encrypted and stored in the Secure Element of the device. The mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. The NFC chip is fitted across the top of the phone. The Device Account Number in the Secure Element is walled off from iOS and not backed up to iCloud. Users can make purchases in stores and within apps, with credit cards issued by many US banks , which make up 83 percent of the credit card purchase volume in the country. The mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. The NFC chip is fitted across the top of the phone. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. It uses the Passbook app and cards that are already on file with iTunes can be saved to it. Users can also take a picture of their own credit card and add it to the account. This is verified by the card's bank before being accepted. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. This won't cancel the cards, either, because the card details themselves are not stored on that device. Apple said it is 'working hard' on bringing it to the UK, although a date has yet to be announced .\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"By . Victoria Allen . Teacher Eppie Sprung Dawson has moved the teenager, now 18, into her home despite being on the sex offenders' register . A teacher caught having an affair with her 17-year-old pupil is now living with him in her marital home, two months after being placed on the sex offenders’ register. Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, lost her job and her marriage after being discovered half-naked in a layby with teenager Matthew Robinson. She narrowly escaped a prison sentence and is now working behind a bar in Dumfries. But she has moved the boy she was caught with into her house, to the distress of his parents who are appealing to him to come home. Matthew, now 18, left his parents’ farmhouse last week after a row with his mother over failing to tidy his room. He is now living with his former teacher and they fear he may not return. The teenager’s mother, Sheree Robinson, said: ‘We had a normal family row about his room being untidy and he just left. He rang Eppie to come and pick him up. ‘We don’t know what she is after and what is in her mind. ‘I think the whole family are still in shock. You send your child to school and you expect them to to be safe. 'She is a sex offender - she has abused her power and her position to gain the trust of a child and to do this. ‘Given he was 17 when this happened, she should have gone to jail.’ The young teacher’s affair was exposed when they were caught together in her car following a school dance last December. The pair were half-naked when police knocked on the window and she pleaded guilty to sexual activity with a person under 18 while she was in a position of trust and his teacher. Sprung Dawson escaped being jailed at the court case in July but was ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for six months and given a six-month community payback order. She lost her job at St Joseph’s College in Dumfries and separated from her husband of two years, Ranald Dawson, also a teacher and the son of former Solicitor General for Scotland Lord Dawson. But just minutes after appearing in the dock, Matthew’s father, Jonathan Robinson, revealed the disgraced teacher telephoned his son. The pair have stayed in close contact and she has showered the youngster with expensive Xbox computer games and rugby tops. Engineer Mr Robinson, 45, said: ‘She’s just generally keeping him there by buying him things. ‘She has got her hooks into him at the moment. She just can’t let go.’ Dawson had sex with the student after she offered to give extra help to at St Joseph's College, Dumfries . Matthew’s family fear they will become a couple, although he has insisted to his parents that they are just friends. The pair are currently living together in Sprung Dawson’s house in an upmarket area of Dumfries, which she shared with her husband before he walked out. Mrs Robinson, a mother of six, said she and her husband had begged the teacher, who they knew from parents’ evenings, to end the relationship following the trial. She said: ‘We asked her to our farmhouse to talk to her and we thought it was resolved because she said she was happy to leave him alone and it was Matthew’s choice. ‘We now know she went and rang him shortly afterwards. She didn’t do what we asked her and she was devious. It is clear she wants more out of the relationship than Matthew but he has no chance to meet a girl his own age while he is living there.’ Instead of backing off from Matthew, Mrs Sprung Dawson is said to have bombarded him with text messages and phone calls. She grew close to Matthew after giving the dyslexic schoolboy extra lessons to help him with his studies. Sprung Dawson's marriage to husband Ranald ended after the affair was revealed and the student is now living in their former marital home in Dumfries . During their secret affair, she took him to a hotel in Carlisle for a romantic trip and attended parties with his teenage friends. His parents had no suspicions and Matthew told them he was playing rugby. The first they knew was when the police turned up at their door last year. Their son, now a carpentry and joinery student at Dumfries College, has given no indication he will return home and his parents say he has become isolated from friends his own age. Mrs Sprung Dawson, who is undergoing psychosexual counselling after telling Dumfries Sheriff Court she had been molested by an older man at the age of 13, was not at home yesterday. The owner of the Slipstream bar, where she now works, said she had been given as much time off as she needed following the renewed attention over her relationship and had gone to Edinburgh. No one was available for comment at the house she shares with Matthew. The family of Matthew Robinson have said they have ‘no clue’ what to do next, and have refused to visit him at Sprung Dawson’s home. Mrs Robinson said she believed the teenager had been pursued by his teacher, adding: ‘He is a teenage boy and what teenage boy would not have done what he did? ‘We are still in shock over everything that has happened. ‘My son’s future is at stake and we feel that she has got away with it. I just hope that he comes home.’\",\n",

Concreting over flood plains, cutting down trees and expanding cities is making flooding much worse – and we need to act on that knowledge, they said. The exact link between global warming and flooding is much less certain, and those who keep pursuing the topic are taking attention away from the true problem of over-development, they said in a research paper. Over-development: Building on flood plains, cutting down trees and the expansion of cities are to blame for flooding, eminent scientists have claimed . Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured left, claimed global warming was to blame for the floods but Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, pictured right, refused to endorse Cameron's views . David Cameron ignited a row at the height of the recent UK floods by proclaiming that he ‘very much’ suspected the devastation had been caused by climate change. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson refused to endorse the Prime Minister’s views and the Met Office said there was no evidence that the winter floods had been caused by man-made global warming. The 19 scientists, from prestigious universities and institutes in Britain, the US, Japan, Australia and across Europe, said that while greenhouse gas emissions are ‘strongly linked’ to flooding, there is insufficient evidence to accurately describe the connection. They said that until there is firm evidence about the role of climate change, it is better to concentrate on what we do know – that the way we are changing our physical landscape is making flooding worse. Many of the authors, all respected climate change scientists, have contributed to UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports. They include Professor Nigel Arnell, from Reading University’s department of meteorology, Robert Muir-Wood, a\\xa0 London-based consultant who advises the OECD and UN. Scientists claim there is no firm evidence to link climate change to flooding. Much of the UK was affected by floods in December, including Cookham, Berkshire, after the River Thames burst its banks and flooded homes and gardens worth millions . The paper, published in the Hydrological Sciences Journal yesterday, says: ‘There is such a furore of concern about the linkage between greenhouse forcing [the process by which man-made greenhouse gases are said to force climate change] and floods that it causes society to lose focus on the things we already know for certain about floods and how to mitigate and adapt to them. ‘Blaming climate change for flood losses . makes flood losses a global issue that appears to be out of the control . of regional or national institutions. 'The scientific community needs to emphasize that the problem of flood losses is mostly about what we do on or to the landscape and that will be the case for decades to come.’ The authors say we know there is a clear link between population density and flooding. Millions of houses and businesses have been built on flood plains, meaning that when rivers burst their banks the water flows onto roads and concrete, rather than bare earth. When it cannot soak into the ground it causes untold damage. Cutting down trees – which take up water – exacerbates the problem, as does changing the course of rivers for irrigation and to make way for more developments. But the authors say that when it comes to climate change they had only ‘low confidence’ in models that try to forecast the impact on flooding. Different solution: Scientists are calling for governments to look at the way changing physical landscapes is causing flooding, pictured near Langport in Somerset . ‘The linkages between enhanced greenhouse forcing and flood phenomena are highly complex and it has not been possible to describe the connections well, either by empirical analysis or by the use of models,’ they say. But they add: ‘It is clear that current trends in human activity on the landscape continue to cause an increase in flood damages. ‘Decreasing or reversing this trend will require substantial attention from governments, private citizens, scientists and engineers, and the actions needed to accomplish this are largely the same regardless of the nature of the greenhouse gas-flood linkage.’ Bob Ward, policy director at the London School of Economics Grantham Institute, disagreed, warning that talking about climate change is vital to the debate. ‘Four of the five wettest years on record in the UK have all occurred since 2000, with 2012 being the second wettest, and this winter shaping up to be the wettest ever,’ he said. The row about spending on Britain’s flood defences continued yesterday, when the Committee on Climate Change – the Government’s independent advisory body – said spending shortfalls could lead to £3billion in avoidable damage from a serious flood in future.\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"A group of 19 eminent scientists from prestigious institutions in Britain, the US, Japan, Australia, and Europe has warned that the debate over climate change is diverting attention from the true causes of flooding. According to their research paper published in the Hydrological Sciences Journal, over-development, such as building on flood plains, cutting down trees, and expanding cities, is significantly exacerbating flood risks. While they acknowledge that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change, they argue that there is insufficient evidence to definitively connect climate change to increased flooding. Instead, they urge a focus on known factors, such as population density and landscape changes, which are directly contributing to flood damage.\\n\\nThe scientists emphasize that building on flood plains, deforestation, and altering river courses for development prevent water from soaking into the ground, leading to more severe flooding. They also note that the scientific community should highlight the immediate and controllable factors affecting flood risks, rather than attributing them to global issues beyond local control.\\n\\nThis perspective contrasts with Prime Minister David Cameron's assertion that climate change likely caused recent UK floods, a view not endorsed by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson or the Met Office. The Committee on Climate Change, however, warns that underfunding of flood defenses could result in significant future damages,\",\n",

Among the marks the game has left on his frame over the years is a classic rugby war wound, one that is increasingly rare in the modern, headgear-wearing era: a cauliflower ear. But his is a minor example compared to some former players. A bluffer\\'s guide to rugby union . England scrum coach and former player Graham Rowntree is naturally blessed with ears like taxi doors, but the former loosehead prop augmented them with years of hard service in front row of the scrum. As one of the ways to restart play, the set scrum is also one area of the game that can be hard to referee -- and what really goes on in there is only really known by the players themselves. But if the battle scars of rugby haven\\'t changed much since Shaw first started playing in 1990, he says that pretty much every other part of the game has been transformed. New Zealand\\'s World Cup obsession . Professionalism, training regimes, nutritionists and physios have all combined to create the modern players\\' physiques. \"It amuses me that in adverts and in films that get made about rugby, often they\\'re blokes that are overweight and with beer bellies. That\\'s not the case anymore,\" Shaw says. \"Bumps and minor injuries are part and parcel of the game, given the strength and the speed of players playing now. But also guys now are conditioned more to take the hits. \"It can look worse than it is as these days there are something like 15 TV cameras trained on every game. It can even be in 3-D and you can watch it in slow motion.\" That\\'s easy for Shaw to say. His enduring toughness has given him the ability to play at the highest level for over 20 years. But for armchair spectators, the hard-hitting part of rugby they find so appealing remains best sampled vicariously. \"I\\'ve played with dislocated fingers. You often get (injuries) a couple of days before a game. You just tape them up and get on with it,\" Shaw says. The ultimate example of \"getting on with it\" must be former New Zealand captain Wayne \"Buck\" Shelford. In a match against France in 1986, his scrotum was ripped by an opponent\\'s studded boot. It\\'s a horrific injury that would make most never want to play again, but Shelford went to the sideline, had it stitched up and amazingly went back on the field to play the rest of the match. Shelford has said that he doesn\\'t remember the incident or the game itself, having also been knocked out and losing a few teeth as well. Rules have tightened up against dangerous play to curb stray boots and flying fists. \"The game isn\\'t quite as ferocious nowadays,\" says Shaw. \"Well, basically there are not quite as many fights.\" Spear tackling and taking out players who are jumping for the ball are not allowed because of the potentially career or even life-threatening consequences. As well as tighter laws, having so many cameras at big matches has meant that players can\\'t get away with any foul play behind the referee\\'s back. Certainly nothing like the organized brawl that took place on the British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa in 1974 that has become a rugby legend. After some violent play in previous matches, Lions captain Willie John McBride decided before the match in Port Elizabeth that his team would \"get their retaliation in first\" at the first sign of South African aggression. When \"99\" was called at a lineout, each one of the 15 Lions players took a swing at an opponent, meaning the referee couldn\\'t identify the instigator of the fight. Not one player was sent off. As he looks forward to what will probably be his last international appearances, Shaw has no nostalgia for the old days. The game remains tough enough without too many of the extras. \"The level of rucking (a contest for the ball after a tackle) has pretty much been eradicated from the game, which has made it a lot safer. You don\\'t come away from a game with a road map on your back made of ruck marks.\"',\n",

Most Americans know the house of God, also called the Cathedral Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, as a place where sacred rites are carried out on behalf of the nation.  It has been host to the funerals of numerous presidents and of inaugural prayer services for four presidents, including Barack Obama. But it is also an active house of worship in the Episcopalian Church, said the Cathedral\\'s dean, Gary Hall. The denomination has developed a blessing rite that mirrors current wedding ceremonies for heterosexual couples and allows each bishop to decide to allow same-sex marriages in their churches or not. Bishop Mariann Budde decided to allow the rite, since same-sex marriage is legal in the District of Columbia and now in neighboring Maryland as well, Hall said. It was Budde\\'s decision that led Hall to create the same-sex rite. He sees it as \"another historic step toward greater equality.\" The states of Washington, Maine and Maryland all legalized same-sex marriages in referendums during the 2012 general election.  It was already legal in the nation\\'s capital. In March, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in two appeals cases related to same-sex marriage -- California\\'s Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage and the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to same-sex couples. The American Episcopal Church is intimately connected with the Church of England, which last week approved the advancement of male priests in same-sex committed relationships to the position of bishop.  But those relationships must be celibate. City halls in Baltimore; Portland, Maine; and Seattle erupted in celebration as the first same-sex couples tied the knot in December and January. Seattle\\'s ceremony included 133 couples, who walked outside and down rain-slickened steps afterward, where they were greeted by cheers, confetti and a brass band celebrating the first day same-sex couples could marry in Washington. To wed at the National Cathedral, one member of the couple must be baptized into the Church, and both must commit to a Christian marriage of \"lifelong faithfulness, love, forbearance and mutual comfort.\"',\n",

Other boys, laughingly saying the girl had to be dead because she didn\\'t flinch as her body was violated. An alleged rape, made into a joke. The images and social media messages are at the heart of criminal charges against two high school football players accused of sexually assaulting an underage teenage girl during a series of end-of-summer parties in August. Both boys are charged with rape. One also is accused of \"illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material.\" Their trial before an Ohio juvenile court judge is scheduled for February 13. CNN is not identifying the girl, who is a juvenile, in accordance with its policy not to release the names of alleged rape victims. The alleged attackers also are juveniles, but they have been identified by a judge in court, by defense attorneys and in newspapers and other media reports as Trent Mays and Ma\\'lik Richmond, both 16. The case has attracted the attention of bloggers and even Anonymous, a loosely organized cooperative of activist hackers. Anonymous has released information about the town and the football team and is threatening to release more unless everyone comes clean about what happened that August night. \"The town of Steubenville has been good at keeping this quiet and their star football team protected,\" an Anonymous member wearing the group\\'s trademark Guy Fawkes mask says in a video posted to the group\\'s LocalLeaks website. The organization, he says, will not allow \"a group of young men who turn to rape as a game or sport get the pass because of athletic ability or small-town luck.\" The girl was assaulted the night of Saturday, August 11, and early the next morning, according to authorities. Involved, according to authorities, were members of the Steubenville High School football team, demigods in the small, down-on-its-luck town along the banks of the Ohio River. A website dedicated to the team counts down the seconds to their return next fall. Police got involved on August 14, when the girl\\'s mother came forward to report the alleged assault, according to Steubenville police Chief William McCafferty. The family provided a zip drive showing a Twitter page, possibly with a photo, the chief told CNN. A kidnapping charge was dropped by the Juvenile Court judge at a probable cause hearing last October, said McCafferty and Mays\\'s attorney, Adam Nemann. \"My client asserts his innocence, and he looks forward to his day in court,\" said Nemann. At an October hearing, attorney Walter Madison, who is representing Richmond, raised questions about the alleged victim\\'s actions that night, according to CNN affiliate WTOV. On August 27, the same day authorities charged the two defendants, Jefferson County authorities asked for help from the attorney general\\'s office in investigating and prosecuting the case. Interviews and witness statements led to the arrests, McCafferty said. \"What we want is to be able to show the citizens of Jefferson County that everything that can be done in this case is being done, and if that means eliciting the help of these people from the attorney general\\'s office, then that\\'s what we want to do in this case,\" county prosecutor Jane Hanlin told WTOV at the time. By that time, images and messages from that night had made their way around social media. Crime blogger Alexandria Goddard, a former Steubenville resident, discovered and preserved many of the messages, at least some of which are now in the hands of authorities. She first spotted the story in the small town\\'s newspaper and started looking into the situation on a hunch that the highly regarded football team\\'s members were getting special treatment at the expense of the victim. \"When I first came across the article, I just felt like -- because it was involving football players, and there is a culture there that football is very important, that there was probably a little more to this story than what the local media was reporting,\" she told CNN Thursday. \"So I started doing my own research.\" One image circulated online and posted on a website maintained by Anonymous showed the girl, dressed in a T-shirt and blue shorts, her body limp, being held hand and foot by two males who appear to be teenagers. Text messages posted to social networking sites that night seemed to brag about the incident, calling the girl \"sloppy,\" making references to rape and suggesting even that she had been urinated on, according to Goddard. CNN has not been able to establish whether this is true. In one 12-minute video, posted by Anonymous on Wednesday, one teenager makes joke after joke about the girl\\'s condition, saying she must have died because she didn\\'t move during one assault. Anonymous and others in the video identified the teen by a name that doesn\\'t match the two who were charged, but CNN cannot independently confirm his identity. \"Is it really rape because you don\\'t know if she wanted to or not,\" the teenager says on the video. \"She might have wanted to. That might have been her final wish.\" Other male voices can be heard off-camera, laughing and talking about the alleged assault. McCafferty said he cannot say who shot that video. \"The subject in that video was interviewed. He wasn\\'t charged,\" the chief told CNN. \"The attorney general\\'s office has all this. It appears to me after I watched the video he was intoxicated.\" The New York Times reported that a cell phone photo from that night shows the girl naked on the floor. Roughly 11 cell phones and a couple of iPads were seized during the investigation, said McCafferty, adding he was not involved in retrieving evidence from the electronic devices. McCafferty said \"there was evidence on some of the phones.\" A special unit with the attorney general\\'s office is doing the work, the chief said. McCafferty said there was a report of a video showing the alleged attack, but authorities don\\'t have it or know whether it exists. The attorney for the girl\\'s family told CNN that the girl is in counseling and is \"doing as well as one can expect.\" \"She\\'s trying to go about her life right now, which is difficult because of all the media attention,\" said family attorney Robert Fitzsimmons. \"It\\'s as if she\\'s just flown into this barnstorm. She\\'ll make it through.\" The case is now in the hands of special prosecutors under Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. DeWine said that the case is being aggressively prosecuted and remains under active investigation. \"We want to make sure that there is no stone left unturned,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that every one in the community really feels that justice has been done and that all the information does in fact come out.\" The parents of one teenager named on Goddard\\'s blog sued her for defamation and sought to have those who anonymously commented on the blog about the case publicly identified. The family has since dropped the lawsuit, according to court documents. Meanwhile, Anonymous says it is collecting detailed information about the personal affairs of football boosters and others in the town of 18,000 who the group claims may have helped cover up the attack. It\\'s also planning a protest \"to help those who have been victimized by the football team or other regimes.\" The group has already hacked the website of the local football fansite and says it will release the information if people don\\'t come forward to help the investigation. \"My heart goes out to the victim,\" DeWine said. \"The victim continues to be victimized every time something shows up on the Internet. There\\'s nothing I can do about that, but it is very, very sad.\" CNN\\'s Ross Levitt and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report .',\n",

Three members of an Eastern European family who flew 'benefit tourists' into the UK to illegally claim £750,000 in tax credits were jailed today. Julius Ziga, 34, his then partner Magdalena Ferkova, 33, her sister Iveta, 32, their aunt Alena Lackova, 39, and her husband Jan Lacko, 39, ran a two-year scam swindling the tax credits system. They brought friends and family from Slovakia and the Czech Republic to Nottingham to make benefit claims, then continued to collect the cash after the claimants returned home. Ringleaders: Julius Ziga, left, 34, and Magdalena Ferkova, right, 33, brought Czechs and Slovaks to claim child tax credits in Britain then continued collecting the cash after the foreigners returned to Eastern Europe . Also jailed: Iveta Ferkova, 32, left, and Jan Lacko, 39, right, were part of the gang which managed around 50 fraudulent child tax credit claims to pocket up to £33,000 a week, much of which was gambled away . Between January 2008 and April 14, 2010, the four pocketed up to £33,000 a week, using the cash to gamble in casinos as well as splash out on luxury cars, including a Mercedes and BMW 5 series. Nottingham Crown Court heard the gang managed around 50 false claims to steal £750,000 in tax credits from HMRC - and would have gone on to steal a further £500,000 had they not been caught. Ziga, Lacko and Iveta Ferkova were all jailed at Nottingham Crown Court today for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Lackova was handed a suspended sentence on the same charge. Magdalena Ferkova was not sentenced today with the court told she has fled the country in an effort to escape punishment. An international arrest warrant has been issued. The court heard Nottingham-based gang, . who are originally from the Czech Republic, flew or drove people into . the UK and helped them to claim tax credits. Ziga . and his then partner Magdalena Ferkova led the fraud, with Ziga at . times driving to Eastern Europe to bring foreigners into the country via . the Channel Tunnel. Others were flown into the country by Ziga to live at 14 addresses across Nottingham. They . arranged housing and National Insurance numbers and posed as . interpreters for the workers during interviews in banks and at job . centres. After applications . for tax credits were made, the claimants were then sent back to their . home countries while the money was paid into bank accounts controlled by . the gang. Sisters Magdalena . Ferkova, 33, and Iveta Ferkova, 32; Jan Lacko, 39, and Alena Lackova, . 39, all from Nottingham, were found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud . by false representation following a trial at Nottingham Crown Court. Julius Ziga, 34, also of Nottingham, pleaded guilty to the same charge at an earlier hearing. CCTV footage of the HSBC in Arnold, Nottingham, shows Magdalena Ferkova with Julius Pesta: . The gang got National Insurance numbers for the workers and posed as . interpreters in interviews at banks and Jobcentres . Sentencing three members of the gang . to jail for a total of 12 years, Judge James Sampson told them: 'You . have all been convicted of conspiracy to defraud the HMRC. 'Beginning . in 2008 you four, together with Magdalena Ferkova and others, in effect . used by you, stole approximately £750,000 in tax credits by making and . managing some 50 or so false claims. 'You . are all related and you are all from the Czech Republic. You cynically, . greedily and dishonestly exploited the tax credit system by bringing to . this country friends and family. 'With . the connivance of these people who supplied their passports and birth . certificates for their children you claimed tax credits in their names. 'They . were then transported back while you managed their claims and bank . accounts in their names. You kept most of the money for yourselves, . sending some, a very limited amount, back to those claimants.' The judge added: 'This was fraudulent from the outset. It was well organised and the sums obtained were considerable.' The gang, including Elena Lackova and Jan Lacko, left, managed around 50 false claims to steal £750,000 in tax credits from HMRC, using the cash to buy cars like the 5 Series BMW pictured left with Magdalena Ferkova . Prosecutor Luke Blackburn told the . court the fraud was uncovered 'by chance' when a boarder agency staff . stopped Ziga at random before he got on a Channel Tunnel train to . Europe. He added: 'When his . phone was analysed they found texts welcoming him to France and Germany . and in a Lidl bag found at an address was documents relating to flights . and trips to Europe. 'In that bag were many original documents, passports and forms relating to benefit claims. 'Ziga’s fingerprints were found on that bag and several articles in the bag. 'The Crown can never know exactly how much money was gambled away in cash. 'But we can say that both Magdalena Ferkova and Iveta Ferkova had active gambling habits. 'Some of the money was used with casino accounts, but we can never know how much was gambled in cash at the casinos. 'When . HMRC investigated the 14 addresses they found a total of 66 claims, 48 . were still outstanding, of which only four were found to be true claims. 'This . was a complex fraud, carried out by a professional organisation dealing . with the movement of people on and international scale. 'The close to the public purse is huge. The proceeds have all gone, either out of the country or gambled.' Innovative filing system: Paperwork is stashed in a microwave at a Nottingham home controlled by the gang . Ziga was jailed for four years while Iveta Ferkova was handed a five-year sentence. Lacko was jailed for three years while his wife Lackova was given a two-year prison sentence, suspended for two years. The judge ordered that those going to prison will be deported when they are released after serving half of their sentence. As the foursome were jailed family members who had packed the public gallery stormed out of the court room. Gary Lampon, assistant director of criminal investigation for HMRC, said after the case : 'This gang was extremely well organised and ruthless in their ambition to steal vast amounts of public money at the expense of the British taxpayer. 'They exploited the many individuals they lured to the UK from abroad with the promise of legal employment, but then manipulated and discarded them.' Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'It’s deeply worrying that our soft-touch welfare system was so easily exploited by criminals.' A proceeds of crime hearing to determine what assets should be seized from the gang will be held at a later date.\",\n",

The idea that they are adding to a housing shortage for younger generations by stubbornly refusing to move out is a myth, according to Saga. The firm, which provides services for the over-50s, said many retirees wanted to buy more practical accommodation but were prevented by a lack of choice. Saga, which provides services for the over-50s, said many retirees wanted to buy more practical accommodation rather than stay in the family home but were prevented by a lack of choice . The news comes as a report by Knight Frank urged house builders to focus on providing attractive accommodation for pensioners to offset a potential care home crisis. The estate agent warned that the ageing population could be forced into care homes unnecessarily if more flexible retirement housing was not built. It said this should include ‘aspirational’ accommodation resembling ‘five-star hotels’ with spas, pools, gyms, manicured gardens and several restaurants. Meanwhile, a Saga survey of 10,000 over-50s found almost half would consider moving into more appropriate housing in retirement, rather than stay in their large family house. A fifth said they would move to provide money for a retirement free of financial worries, while one in 14 said they wanted to release money to help their families. Saga said more people would consider ‘rightsizing’ – moving into a home that suited their retirement needs better – if appropriate housing was available. The survey found that almost three-quarters of these wanted something more practical rather than simply smaller. Of those who would consider a move, half would look into buying a bungalow and a quarter would consider a purpose-built retirement apartment. Only one in ten said that being close to relatives was important when looking for a home in retirement. Estate agent Knight Frank has warned that the ageing population could be forced into care homes unnecessarily if more flexible retirement housing was not built (file picture) Lisa Harris, head of communications for Saga, said: ‘Older homeowners are more than willing to consider rightsizing as they approach retirement and have thrown down the gauntlet to developers to build housing with them in mind.’ Knight Frank found Britain was failing to encourage people to downsize because of a lack of retirement housing. Tens of thousands of older people would be able to maintain their independence for longer if there was more ‘supported housing’ in attractive retirement villages which they ‘aspired’ to move to, it said. This would free up larger homes for younger families. The firm found that less than 1 per cent of private housing being built was for the elderly, warning this was not enough for an ageing population. The number of over-65s in the UK is set to double to 20million in 30 years. Just 1 per cent of Britain’s over-60s live in retirement communities, compared to 17 per cent in the US and 13 per cent in Australia and New Zealand. Emma Cleugh, head of institutional consultancy at Knight Frank, said: ‘The Government should be urged to support far more progressively the needs of older people in terms of high quality housing, care and an aspirational lifestyle.’ Official figures show three-quarters of people aged 60 and over own their own home, compared with less than a third of those aged 25 to 34.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\\'s sister lost her bid for a seat in the nation\\'s parliamentary elections, a result seen as a blow to the controversial leader and, according to one analyst, a \"possible sign of fraud.\" Parvin Ahmadinejad, running in her family\\'s hometown of Garmsar, was defeated by a conservative rival in Friday\\'s elections for the Majlis, Iran\\'s parliament, the country\\'s news outlets said Saturday. More than 64 percent of eligible voters streamed to the polls in large numbers, and election officials praised the exercise, in which about 3,400 candidates vied for Majlis seats. It\\'s first time Iranians are voting since allegations of rigging in the 2009 elections triggered mass street protests against President Ahmadinejad\\'s re-election. Many observers say the underlying issue of the election is whether voters back the president, who has been in a rivalry with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Khamenei publicly supported Ahmadinejad\\'s controversial re-election victory during the dispute over the 2009 ballot results. But tensions have flared between the two leaders over the past year, with Ahmadinejad disappearing from public view for 11 days after the supreme leader overruled his decision to fire an intelligence minister. Several of Ahmadinejad\\'s top political allies have also been subjected to lawsuits and investigations. But in the run-up to this week\\'s vote, the supreme leader urged factions to overcome previous divisions and repeatedly called for unity. The current Majlis speaker, Ali Larijani, and Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the current chairman of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, were re-elected, state media said. Conservatives backing Khamenei or with links to him performed well in the race. One candidate, Gholam Ali Haddad Adel, was overwhelmingly leading his race. His daughter is married to Khamenei\\'s son. But one observer suggested the defeat of the president\\'s sister could be a sign of political fraud. \"In Iran, locals are usually fiercely loyal to high ranking representatives from their area, even if they are unpopular at national level,\" said Meir Javedanfar, an Israeli-Iranian Middle East analyst. \"Although Ahmadinejad is not a popular politician, the very fact that his sister was defeated in Garmsar is a valid possible sign of fraud. This is likely to lead to even more infighting.\" Solat Mortazavi, the deputy Interior minister overseeing the elections, praised the polling. \"These have been the most lawful elections,\" he said. \"The elections were conducted in the best possible way.\" Mortazavi said it was the first time Iran successfully used computerized voting systems in some polling stations. Final results might be released in a matter of days. He said flooding delayed the retrieval of ballot boxes from remote communities. During the post-election crackdown three years ago, security forces used deadly force to crack down on the opposition Green Movement and presidential candidates Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi were placed under house arrest, where they remain. There were no candidates from the Green Movement in this year\\'s parliamentary election. Iranian political analysts describe the vote as a contest between rival conservative factions within the government. The predominantly Shiite nation faces an escalating international outcry and Western sanctions over its nuclear program, prompting leaders to call for a higher voter turnout to establish legitimacy.',\n",

Mario Careaga, 46, of Fort Lauderdale, was immediately taken into custody Thursday after the ruling by Broward Circuit Judge Ilona M. Holmes. He is scheduled for sentencing on May 5, and faces between four and 15 years in prison. Lopez-Ruiz's family sobbed in court Wednesday, after the all-male jury delivered its guilty verdict following 10 hours of deliberations. However, that decision as immediately questioned after an alternate juror, who had been dismissed from the case, accused another juror of exhibiting an anti-gay bias during the trial. Guilty: Mario Careaga, 46, of Fort Lauderdale, pictured right on Thursday, was found guilty of DUI manslaughter in the gory 2010 death of a 22-year-old Miami Heat dancer . Carrega is gay and his partner of 20 years, Ray Stapleton, gave testimony. On Thursday, Stapleton urged the public Thursday to continue praying for the victim's family. 'They're good people,' he said, according to the Sun Sentinel. Careaga crashed his Mercedes into the victim who had stopped her motorcycle on the side of the road in Fort Lauderdale at 9:38 p.m. on September 10, 2010, sending her flying more than 130 feet into the air. One juror was accused of mocking the Cargeaga's voice as he testified and using an expletive to describe Bogenschutz. The alternate juror told defense lawyer David Bogenschutz Tuesday he thought this could affect the outcome of the trial. Bogenschutz brought the allegations to Judge Holmes on Tuesday afternoon. The Sentinel reported that after Wednesday's verdict, Holmes spoke with each juror individually to ask whether they heard or said anything disparaging about gays - non of them had. Justice: Nancy Lopez-Ruiz' mother, Adela, pictured Thursday, said she feels justice has been served . Relieved: The dancer's family were relieved with the verdict . The juror denied both accusations, instead saying he had been clearing his throat during Careaga's testimony. Nevertheless, the judge decided to hold off on formally entering the jury's verdict until Thursday morning. But in the end she decided against declaring a mistrial and upheld the verdict. Clutched a figurine of an angel she'd received from her daughter, the victim's mother, Adela Lopez-Ruiz, talked of her relief. 'Justice came for Nancy,' she said, according to the Sentinel. 'We trust the justice system, and we are pleased that justice was served.' She has been a vocal opponent to drink driving since her daughter's death. At the beginning of the trial, Adela sobbed as she told reporters, 'I have no words to express the pain' of losing her daughter. The beautiful 22-year-old was killed after she pulled over her Suzuki sport motorcycle on the side of the road and Careaga crossed three lanes of traffic in his white 2009 Mercedes-Benz, slamming into her. Tragic: Miami Heat cheerleader Nancy Lopez-Ruiz, pictured left and right, was thrown 137 feet to her death .

She was pronounced dead at the scene. 'For a mother, for a father, yes, it is very, very hard,' Adela Lopez told wsvn.com. 'It's in the hands of the people who serve justice. We are anticipating that justice will be served.' Her father, Armando, added that seeing his daughter's alleged killer for the first time was 'very hard.' The . cheerleader grew up in the Bradenton area and was a college student . living in Plantation when she tried out and won a spot as a Miami Heat . dancer. She was supposed to start performing publicly in October 2010. On the night of the deadly crash she was reportedly coming home from practice. Meanwhile, Careaga, a wealthy insurance executive, was spotted at an event at a nearby mall shopping for jewellery with a glass of champagne in his hand just one hour before the collision. According to police, his blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit, at .23 and .24 percent. According to responding police, he was 'swaying from side to side and in a circular motion.' They also said he had 'bloodshot, . glassy eyes, slurred speech, the odor of alcoholic beverages coming from . his person, unsteady balance and difficulty supporting himself.' A video of the crash was shown to jurors. In court on during the trial, Careago looked uncomfortable. He has been free on bond as he awaited his trial, which has faced repeated delays.

A cat lost one of his nine lives when he plunged 70-foot from a viaduct - and survived. Bengal cat Gus badly broke a leg when he fell from the viaduct in Frampton Mansell, Gloucestershire, but managed to drag himself to safety under a trailer nearby. The 18-month-old cat was saved from certain death by maggots which nibbled the necrotising flesh away from his broken leg and prevented blood poisoning. He was discovered six days after the plunge by a stunned dog walker who called his owner Caroline Bush, 39. New addition to the family: The children of Caroline Bush, the dog walker who discovered Bengal Cat, Gus . Mrs Bush rushed Gus to Clockhouse Veterinary Hospital in Wallbridge, Glos., where staff were sceptical about his chances of survival. But amazingly, Gus pulled through following an operation to remove his leg and is happily back with his family. Mrs Bush, who runs as dog walking business with husband Ian, said children Sashi, 10, Fintan, nine, and Orlah, six, were delighted Gus was home. She said: 'We had a phone call from a gentleman who said, I think your cat is under my trailer. We were on our way to school at the time so we went straight there. Only eight more lives: The viaduct at Frampton Mansell from which Gus the cat fell more than 60 feet . 'I helped him out but his leg had rotted away. It just looked like a shrivelled up banana skin.

Inside the hospital at the National Institutes of Health, researchers are testing a possible new treatment to help heavy drinkers cut back - using a replica of a fully stocked bar. The idea: Sitting in the dimly lit bar-laboratory should cue the volunteers' brains to crave a drink, and help determine if an experimental pill counters that urge. True, there's no skunky bar odor; these bottles are filled with colored water. The real alcohol is locked in the hospital pharmacy, ready to send over for the extra temptation of smell - and to test how safe the drug is if people drink anyway. Dr. George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, left, and NIAAA scientist Dr. Lorenzo Leggio pose in a research laboratory designed as a bar inside the National Institutes of Healthís hospital in Bethesda, Maryland . 'The goal is to create almost a real-world environment, but to control it very strictly,' said lead researcher Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, who is testing how a hormone named ghrelin that sparks people's appetite for food also affects their desire for alcohol, and if blocking it helps. Amid all the yearly resolutions to quit, alcohol use disorders affect about 17 million Americans, and only a small fraction receives treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all therapy, and the NIH is spurring a hunt for new medications that target the brain's addiction cycle in different ways - and to find out which options work best in which drinkers. 'Alcoholics come in many forms,' explained Dr. George Koob, director of NIH's National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which has published new online guides, explaining who's at risk and what can help. What's the limit? NIAAA says 'low-risk' drinking means no more than four drinks in any single day and no more than 14 in a week for men, and no more than three drinks a day and seven a week for women. Genes play a role in who's vulnerable to crossing the line into alcohol abuse. So do environmental factors, such as getting used to drinking a certain amount, not to mention how your own brain's circuitry adapts. Treatment can range from inpatient rehab and 12-step programs to behavioral therapy and the few medications available today. Koob, who specializes in the neurobiology of alcohol, says it usually takes a combination and ultimately, 'you have to change your life.' Yet a recent review for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimated that less than a third of people who need treatment get it, and of those, less than 10 percent receive medications. Three drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat alcohol abuse. One, naltrexone, blocks alcohol's feel-good sensation by targeting receptors in the brain's reward system - if people harbor a particular gene. The anti-craving pill acamprosate appears to calm stress-related brain chemicals in certain people. The older Antabuse works differently, triggering nausea and other aversive symptoms if people drink while taking it. Sitting in the dimly lit bar-laboratory should cue the volunteers' brains to crave a drink, and help determine if the experimental pill counters that urge (file picture) Recent research suggests a handful of drugs used for other disorders also show promise: . -Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute found the epilepsy drug gabapentin reduced relapses in drinkers who'd recently quit, and improved cravings, mood and sleep by targeting an emotion-related brain chemical. -A study by NIAAA and five medical centers found the anti-smoking drug Chantix may help alcohol addiction, too, by reducing heavy drinkers' cravings. -And University of Pennsylvania researchers found the epilepsy drug topiramate helped heavy drinkers cut back, if they have a particular gene variation mostly found in people of European descent. Back in NIH's bar lab, one of about a dozen versions around the country, the focus is on ghrelin, the hormone produced in the stomach that controls appetite via receptors in the brain. It turns out there's overlap between receptors that fuel overeating and alcohol craving in the brain's reward system, explained NIAAA's Leggio. In a study published this fall, his team gave 45 heavy-drinking volunteers different doses of ghrelin, and their urge to drink rose along with the extra hormone. Now Leggio is testing whether blocking ghrelin's action also blocks those cravings, using an experimental Pfizer drug originally developed for diabetes but never sold. The main goal of this first-step study is to ensure mixing alcohol with the drug is safe. But researchers also measure cravings as volunteers, hooked to a blood pressure monitor in the tiny bar-lab, smell a favorite drink. Initial safety results are expected this spring. 'Our hope is that down the line, we might be able to do a simple blood test that tells if you will be a naltrexone person, an acamprosate person, a ghrelin person,' Koob said.\",\n",

A new mother claims she was asked by a nurse to move to a private room while breastfeeding her son in a hospital waiting room. Abbie Stocker, 25, said she was left feeling ‘humiliated’ and ‘like a naughty schoolgirl’ as she sat breastfeeding ten-week-old Eric. Mrs Stocker politely declined to leave. But after her son’s appointment with an eye consultant, she says she was forced to finish feeding her baby in a corridor. The case comes at a time of national debate about breastfeeding in public after controversy over Lou Burns, who was told to cover herself and her baby with a napkin in Claridge’s, the exclusive Mayfair hotel. Recalling the latest incident at Burnley Hospital, Mrs Stocker said: ‘There were about five other people in the waiting room with children and none of them seemed concerned. ‘It was clear that the staff were not happy with me breastfeeding in public. I was only offered the chance to return to the waiting room once Eric had finished his feed. ‘I felt humiliated, like a naughty schoolgirl who had been made to wait outside the headteacher’s office.’ Last week Ukip leader Nigel Farage stirred the controversy when he suggested mothers should be willing to ‘sit in the corner’ in restaurants when breastfeeding. His comments in response to the incident at Claridge’s came under attack, with David Cameron saying it was ‘totally unacceptable’ to make mothers feel uncomfortable. Scroll down for video . Mrs Stocker said she was  made to finish feeding 10-week-old Eric in an empty corridor at Burnley General Hospital (pictured) Louise Burns complained that she was asked to place a large napkin over her baby's head in the restaurant at Claridge's in London as she breastfed . Women staged a public breastfeed outside the London hotel last week in protest at women being told to cover up. The new Equality Act states that it amounts to sex discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. The law applies to anyone providing services, facilities and premises to the public, public bodies,further and higher education bodies and association. Women are protected  in public places such as parks, sports and leisure facilities, public buildings and when using public transport such as buses, trains and planes. They are protected in shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels regardless of how big or small. The law also applies in hospitals, theatres, cinemas and petrol stations. Mrs Stocker, who is still breastfeeding her two-year-old daughter Millie, pointed out that the Equality Act states it is illegal to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place. She added: ‘This is not the first time I have experienced discrimination like this but to face it in a hospital that prides itself on promoting breastfeeding is unbelievable. ‘Breastfeeding reduces the mother’s risk of contracting ovarian and breast cancer and it also helps to protect the child from illnesses such as asthma and cancer. ‘I hope this will not discourage other mums because it is one of the best things you can do for your child.’ Last night the hospital said it welcomed breastfeeding mothers in all departments. Anita Fleming, head of midwifery at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ‘It’s disappointing to hear that our offer of a room to allow Mrs Stocker privacy and comfort was misinterpreted on this occasion and we are sorry for any upset.’ A group of mothers  staged a mass breastfeed outside Claridge's after Louise Burns was ordered to cover up .\",\n",

Backlash: Ed Milliband invited Respect MP Mr Galloway to his Commons office . Ed Miliband last night faced an angry backlash from Labour MPs after it emerged he held a secret meeting with George Galloway, who was thrown out of the party ten years ago. The Labour leader invited Respect MP Mr Galloway to his Commons office, where they had a ‘cordial and friendly conversation’ for nearly an hour. It has sparked rumours that Mr Miliband is considering allowing Mr Galloway to rejoin the party. But Labour MPs warned their leader . against taking such action. ‘Galloway is a traitor,’ said one. ‘It’s . naive lunacy for the leader to have anything to do with him. I thought . he wanted to get rid of the Red Ed tag. He will rejoin Labour over my . dead body.’ Mr Galloway was expelled from Labour . after he was accused of inciting foreign forces to rise up against . British troops invading Iraq – military action he strongly opposed. Last year, Mr Galloway humiliated Mr . Miliband by triumphing over Labour in the Bradford West by- election by a . thumping 10,000 votes. If he returned to his former party, it could give Mr Miliband an extra seat at the next General Election in 2015. Mr Miliband believes that winning seats in Labour’s northern stronghold is key to him ousting David Cameron from No\\u2009\\u200910. Controversial character: George Galloway MP, formerly of the Labour Party . Senior Labour sources denied there were plans to let Mr Galloway rejoin the party, saying it was ‘merely a get to know you’ meeting. But friends of Mr Galloway said he was ‘taken aback’ to receive the invitation. ‘Obviously it was an olive branch,’ said one. ‘It is hard to imagine why Ed would want to see him unless he is thinking of letting George back in. They had a very friendly chat and agreed to stay in touch. At one point in the meeting, Mr Miliband asked Mr Galloway why he had left the party. He replied, ‘I didn’t leave, I was thrown out.’ Both men laughed. News of the meeting, said to have taken place a few weeks ago, was leaked days after Mr Galloway greeted Margaret Thatcher’s death by saying: ‘May she burn in the hellfires.’ In 2006, he was ridiculed after taking time off from his MP’s duties to appear on Celebrity Big Brother. During one episode he pretended to be a cat. Labour last night confirmed the meeting took place but insisted there had been no attempt to bring Mr Galloway back into the party as many of his views were ‘unacceptable’.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'Ferrari team principal Stefano Demenicali has rejected suggestions a power struggle between him and driver Fernando Alonso is the reason behind the Italian team\\'s faltering Formula One season. Alonso, a two-time world champion, picked up two grands prix wins in the first five races of the season, but he has struggled to match the blistering pace set by Red Bull\\'s three-time drivers\\' champion Sebastian Vettel. The Spaniard is second in the drivers\\' standings and trails the leader Vettel by 46 points after finishing runner up to the German at Sunday\\'s Belgian Grand Prix. Domenicali, who has been team principal of F1\\'s most successful team since 2008, denied a rift with Alonso and also dismissed suggestions he is too soft for one of motorsport\\'s most demanding jobs. \"No, no, this is something that I totally reject,\" Domenicali told the sport\\'s official website. \"We want to win together. \"It is a super-competitive environment where you are a hero when you win and a zero when you lose -- there is not really something in between for us. Be sure that we are united to win -- because that\\'s what we are here for.\" Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has not been shy in expressing his dissatisfaction with the team. He \"tweaked\" Alonso\\'s ear last month when the driver sarcastically remarked he would like \"someone else\\'s car\" for his birthday. \"He is our chairman and he is very passionate about this part of his job, this side of the business,\" Domenicali said of Di Montezemolo. \"It is normal that he is very pushy with us because we had a really difficult July. It was a sign of attention from him -- I read it this way, that\\'s it. \"We know we need to be focused -- and he reminded us of that -- and that we have to be united to pass this difficult moment.\" Domenicali was also coy on rumors Lotus\\' Kimi Raikkonen could be in line for a return to the team he won the world championship with in 2007 -- Ferrari\\'s last drivers\\' title. \"Kimi is a very fast driver and everybody knows how I rate him. But if I make a comment now it will be taken as a direct answer. \"As I said, there is no rush and we will make the right decision in the right moment.\" Meanwhile David Ward has announced he intends to stand in the FIA\\'s presidential elections later this year. Ward has resigned from his post as director general of world motorsport\\'s governing body\\'s charitable foundation to run for the post currently held by former Ferrari chief Jean Todt. \"After much careful thought I have decided to stand,\" Ward said in a statement. \"The election period begins in September and it will be necessary for me to approach FIA members to secure nominations. \"In these circumstances I think that the correct course of action is to resign. \"Election processes inevitably involve robust and lively debate, and whilst the foundation is independent and there is no legal requirement for me to resign, I believe that it is in the best interests of the charity that I stand down now.\" Frenchman Todt, who has been president of the FIA since 2009, has yet to announce whether or not he intends to run for reelection.',\n",

Almost 12 years into the conflict, 67 per cent of Americans responding to a recent poll agree that the war in Afghanistan hasn’t been worth fighting. Only 28 per cent of Americans believe the war was worth fighting, but an unexpected 53 per cent are against removing all troops from the country. In short, acrimony towards the Afghan War now exceeds the most negative opinions seen against the Iraq War in 2007, during which almost 1,000 US soldiers died carrying out Operation Iraqi Freedom. Americans tiring of Afghanistan: Soldiers carrying the remains of Sgt. Stefan M. Smith, who was killed July 23 when his unit was attacked with an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan . The two-thirds against the war based their beliefs on examining cost versus benefit, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll. This sentiment tops the record 66 per cent of people polled by ABC News/Washington Post to be against the Iraq War in April 2007. Also, unlike in Iraq, the US received overwhelming support invading Afghanistan from countries around the world, which stood in stark contrast to the opposition voiced against the US assault on Iraq led by France, Germany and the United Nations, the latter of which called the military action 'illegal' at the time. Despite only 28 per cent of Americans responding to the poll believing that the war was worth fighting, a surprising 53 per cent are in favor of not removing all troops from Afghanistan, instead supporting the idea that some stay behind to train Afghan forces after the planned 2014 troop exodus. With only 43 per cent of respondents believing the Afghan War has contributed to the long-term security of the United States, sentiment against the conflict is spread across most demographics. It is worth noting, though, that almost 60 per cent of Americans polled in June believed the war did contribute to the long-term security of the US – one month after Navy SEALS killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Weary: Americans are have grown increasingly tired of US troops being involved in Afghanistan . Essentially split on the issue, 51 per cent of Republicans believe the war isn’t worth fighting, according to the poll. An overwhelming 74 per cent of Democrats and 71 pe rcent of independents are also against the war. The United States has seen the deaths of over 2,100 troops since the beginning of the Afghanistan War in 2001, according to military records. By comparison, over 4,400 US soldiers have died since the beginning of the Iraq War.\",\n",

Ailina Tsarnaeva, sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, appeared at a hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court on Wednesday morning, accompanied by her lawyer. The 24-year-old, of North Bergen, New Jersey, is accused of threatening a woman who previously had a romantic relationship with her partner. Scroll down for video .

Tsarnaeva, sister of the accused Boston Marathon Bombing brothers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, exits Manhattan Criminal Court in New York . She was later seen leaving the court in the company of her lawyer. 'Leave my man alone,' she said in a phone call on August 25, according to the criminal complaint relating to the threats. 'Stop looking for him. I have people. I know people that can put a bomb where you live.' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Abreu said Tsarnaeva was apparently referencing her brothers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who had been the subjects of an intense manhunt in the Boston area in the days after the deadly April 2013 marathon bombing. Tamerlan was later killed. Prosecutors said Tsarnaeva had driven past the woman's house since an order of protection was issued.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (left) is charged with building and planting the two pressure cooker bombs that exploded near the Boston marathon's finish line in 2013.  Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right) died after a gunbattle with police . Tsarnaeva's attorney, Susan Marcus, said her woman disputes making such statements. 'My client is an easy target,' Marcus said. 'This is an uncorroborated claim.' Marcus said in September that Tsarnaeva, a mother-of-two, and her family had 'absolutely no means,' and she did not deserve to be jailed. Tsarnaeva avoided jail by pleading guilty last month to misleading a police detective during a counterfeiting investigation in Massachusetts. She entered the plea in South Boston Municipal Court in early November. If she avoids further legal trouble for 30 days, she will be free of any court supervision. If she does get into trouble, the judge could sentence her up to two and a half years in jail. Prosecutors said Tsarnaeva failed to cooperate with a police officer investigating the passing of a counterfeit bill by a group of people eating at an Applebee's restaurant in the South Bay Center, a mall in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, on April 16, 2010. A server saw the group leaving and wrote down their license plate number. She also was arrested in 2009 on charges she left the scene of an accident, but the case was dismissed, prosecutors said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is charged with building and planting the two pressure cooker bombs that exploded near the marathon's finish line, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others. He has pleaded not guilty. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a gunbattle with police.

Stern, was found dead in her hotel room in February 2007. The former Playboy model and reality TV star died five months later of what a Florida medical examiner ruled was from \"acute combined drug intoxication.\" Ira Freeman, the chief pharmacist at Key Pharmacy in Los Angeles, testified on the seventh day of a preliminary hearing for Howard K. Stern -- Smith\\'s lawyer and companion -- and co-defendants Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor. The three are charged with an illegal conspiracy to prescribe, administer and dispense controlled substances to an addict. Stern faces 11 felony counts, and the doctors were charged with six each. They are not charged in her death. Smith\\'s death in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, came just five months after the birth of her daughter, Dannielynn, and the sudden death of her 20-year-old son, Daniel, on September 10, 2006. Freeman testified that Kapoor faxed to him a list of six drugs that Eroshevich wanted to be sent to the Bahamas, where Eroshevich was treating Smith for anxiety and depression in the days after her son\\'s death. \"The more I thought about it, the more concern I had that if she got hold of those medications, it could have fatal consequences\" Freeman said. The pharmacist said the dosages of the drugs were \"not appropriate.\" Freeman said he consulted Dr. Greg Thompson, a pharmaceutical expert, who agreed with him and who offered to talk with Eroshevich about the dangers. Freeman said Thompson later told him that he found Eroshevich, a psychiatrist, to be \"way out of her league\" in her requests for strong drugs for Smith. At the time, Smith was holed up in her home in the Bahamas mourning her son\\'s death. Her bodyguard said in earlier testimony that the home was under siege by photographers, keeping Smith inside with her windows covered. Thompson recommended to Eroshevich that she \"forget the paparazzi and get her to a hospital\" if she needed all of those drugs, Freeman said. Freeman said the stress of the publicity after Smith\\'s death affected his own health, especially after the celebrity Web site TMZ.com published a copy of the faxed list of medications in question. Under questioning by the defense, Freeman said that over the previous five years he had filled prescriptions for Smith, he never saw any \"red flags\" that she was getting dangerous amounts of drugs. Charges against the three defendants also include the use of false names on prescriptions. Freeman said he always understood that prescriptions written under the pseudonym \"Michelle Chase\" were intended for Smith. It was a practice begun in 2001, three years before Kapoor or Eroshevich began treating her, to prevent \"trouble for her in terms of her celebrity status,\" Freeman said. After the preliminary hearing, which could last about three weeks, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry will decide whether a trial will be held. In earlier testimony, Smith\\'s part-time bodyguard Maurice Brighthaupt said \"she just didn\\'t want to deal with life after the death of her son.\" Brighthaupt described Smith as \"manipulative\" when she wanted something. \"She manipulated Dr. Eroshevich,\" he said. Eroshevich, a Los Angeles psychiatrist, traveled to the Bahamas five or six times in 2006 to attend to Smith, he said. They had a mother-daughter friendship, not a doctor-patient relationship, Brighthaupt said. The doctor sometimes substituted placebos for the tray full of pills Smith regularly took for her complaints of pain and depression, he said. \"She was very concerned that we needed to wean her off the medications,\" Brighthaupt said. California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement Special Agent Danny Santiago testified that investigators found 12 prescription drugs, including dangerous opiates, in Smith\\'s hotel room after her death. Seven of them were prescribed using Stern\\'s name, although spelled \"Stearn,\" he said. A series of affidavits used by state investigators to obtain search warrants in their 2½-year inquiry was unsealed last month, revealing many details of the prosecution\\'s case.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'If Manchester United and Liverpool fans are expecting the arrival of superstar players ahead of the new season then they had better think again, as the cost of refinancing debt could significantly curb the club\\'s spending power according to industry experts. Liverpool co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks took over the club in February 2007 . Financial prudence will be the watchword for the majority of the English Premier League in the transfer market as clubs look to consolidate their financial position in a move that could see a shift of power in Europe to Spain\\'s La Liga. United have received $130 million for the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid, but the Glazer family owners will not sanction anywhere near that amount for new players according to Professor Rogan Taylor at the University of Liverpool\\'s Football Industry Group. The Americans\\' takeover of the Red Devils placed the club in $1,100m of debt, according to the holding companies\\' accounts of 2009; a situation that requires careful management. \"The refinancing at Manchester United is structured in a very complex way but ultimately the economic difficulties now mean that there will be a reduction in Alex Ferguson\\'s transfer budget,\" he told CNN. \"Although some of the funds from the Ronaldo transfer will go back into the club\\'s coffers there will be a tightening of the purse strings which will seriously impact on United\\'s capacity to go after the top players. \"Certainly, Ferguson would have wanted a top-class replacement for Ronaldo but with the need to keep the debt in order and -- being unable to compete with Real Madrid and Manchester City -- the funds available and the pool of players from which they can sign is a lot smaller.\"  Liverpool\\'s situation is even more acute as American co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks, through their company Kop Holdings, struggle to secure the finances to fund the club\\'s proposed new stadium. A deal to refinance their $570m Royal Bank of Scotland loan appears to have been secured, but the long-term sustainability of the idea used to purchase Liverpool is serious under question.  Will Liverpool and Manchester United splash the cash in the transfer market despite the financial problems? Who would you like to see them sign? Let us know your comments in the \\'Sound off\\' box below. Professor Taylor added: \"The whole model on which Hicks and Gillett bought Liverpool is flawed and Rafael Benitez may have to sell Javier Mascherano or Xabi Alonso before he can go out and spend during the close season. \"Even then there is no certainty he will get the whole amount from the sale of either of those players back in the transfer kitty so it promises to be a difficult period for Liverpool as obviously expectation has been raised following last season\\'s second-place finish. \"The need to refinance the debt remains key to the American owners remaining in control of the club so that will be their priority -- at the expense of matters on the pitch.\" Jon Keen deputy chairman of the Football Supporters Federation, and an expert in the field of club governance and ownership, admitted the situation at both clubs will stir up further resentment among fans towards their owners. \"The current refinancing situation in the top-flight is like a financial house cards which could come crashing down at any time,\" he told CNN. \"We have already seen a situation unravel with the banking system which has angered a lot of people and something similar could well happen with football in the near future. \"Ultimately fans want to see money raised from sales of players either put back into the transfer pot or levied against their own costs of attending matches, not simply servicing huge amounts of debt as is the case with Manchester United and Liverpool at the moment. \"There needs to be a reality check about the way these clubs are operating. Certainly, I think the current economic climate will drastically reduce the spending power of clubs in the Premier League with the exception perhaps of Manchester City.\" Of course, this contrasts with Spain\\'s Real Madrid who have recently splashed almost $300m on Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema -- and are not finished yet if president Florentino Perez is to be believed. The construction magnate and his powerful board are able to wield influence with banks and allow Real to secure credit on favorable terms which, combined with a lucrative domestic television rights deal, puts them in a stronger financial position. Ultimately this appears to have precipitated a shift away from the English Premier League to La Liga for the world\\'s best players as Spain becomes the preferred destination of choice. Whether Real can convert this into a challenge to the recent English domination of the UEFA Champions League on the pitch remains to be seen.',\n",

Manchester United, despite receiving $130 million from the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid, will not be able to spend heavily due to the club's $1.1 billion debt, which requires careful management. Professor Rogan Taylor from the University of Liverpool's Football Industry Group notes that this will reduce Alex Ferguson's transfer budget and limit the club's ability to sign top players.\\n\\nLiverpool's situation is even more challenging.

No time can be lost. Already the Taliban is regrouping and is poised to fill any power vacuum created by a weak government in Kabul. Warlords are forming coalitions to push back on the Taliban. Afghanistan could be heading toward civil war. Who will bear the brunt?  Women, whose rights can easily be traded off if they are not at the table when decisions are made. In a negotiation without women, if one side says it doesn\\'t want schools for girls because Islam does not permit it, the other side may say sure, no problem. But if women are at the negotiating table, they can make the argument forcefully that Islam does not ban education for girls and that, in fact, Islam supports it. Karzai already has showed he cannot be trusted to support the rights of women by signing a clerical council\\'s \"code of conduct\" for women, which, among other strictures, supports women\\'s segregation, bans women\\'s travel without a male guardian and gives husbands rights to beat their wives in certain circumstances. Seeing this looming threat to American war aims, last week Sens. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, and Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, introduced the Afghan Women and Girls Security Promotion Act. It requires the Defense Department to produce a strategy to promote women\\'s security during the transfer of power to Afghan forces. Casey said that is the only way to achieve our overall goal of a secure and stable Afghanistan. In consultation with Afghan women, we believe four things must be done before the United States loses its bargaining position in Afghanistan after our troops withdraw. Create a coalition of women leaders: A coalition of prominent Afghan women ought to be created with the mandate of providing counsel every time an issue of women\\'s and girls\\' rights is on the negotiating table. Make sure women can vote: The United States must make sure that Afghan elections are not corrupt and that women actually get to vote.  Women will vote against the Taliban if they are free to go to the polls. But we must have election monitors to be sure their votes are not stolen. Imams must become advocates for women: As a deeply religious society, Afghanistan must solve its problems within a framework of Muslim beliefs. The people devoutly follow their imams and mullahs. Our experience shows that through an imam training program, they can become advocates for girls\\' and women\\'s rights.  Expanding our support for these training programs will pay big dividends. Direct aid to support communities: Billions of dollars in U.S. aid will be squandered if Afghan women do not believe they are integral to the political and economic process. We have two years to redirect part of this aid to fortify communities so that Afghan women, imams and community leaders can resist the Taliban on their own terms. If Afghan women suffer again, it will be as if we went to war for no reason.  We must remember that we had three objectives for launching the Afghan war -- capturing Osama bin Laden, defeating al Qaeda and the Taliban and protecting Afghan women and their rights. If we walk away and allow Afghan women to be subjugated, we will have made the same mistake we made after we helped the Mujahedeen push the Soviets out of Afghanistan. We left the country in a power vacuum, which was filled by a radical fringe known as the Taliban. We know how badly that turned out.',\n",

Nigel Leat, 51, was described by a judge as a ‘paedophile of the most sickening order’ when he was jailed indefinitely last year for abusing five girls, some as young as six. Yesterday a damning report showed that the primary school where he worked had catastrophically failed to protect the children in his care. Scroll down for video . Paedophile: Nigel Leat, a married father-of-two, breaks down during questioning by police . Over 14 years, concerns had been raised repeatedly about Leat’s behaviour with pupils, but his conduct was never investigated. He had abused children in the school’s computer room, resource room, staff room and even during lessons with other pupils present. Leat also regularly filmed the pupils’ harrowing ordeals using a camera provided by the school,\\xa0 storing hundreds of films on more than 20 memory sticks labelled with his victims’ names. Staff at Hillside First School in Worle, Somerset, first noticed Leat selecting girls who were ‘less academically able, emotionally needy or pretty’ as his ‘favourites’ a year after he started teaching there in 1996. Sentence: Leat was given an indefinite jail term for his actions . His inappropriate behaviour was so well known that staff tried to prevent children likely to become his ‘star pupils’ from being put into his Year Two and Year Three classes. In 2004, a mother claimed Leat had been taking pictures of her daughter with a mobile phone but he denied the accusation and no action was taken. Four years later, two children told staff that Leat, a married father of two, had been touching their legs and kissing one of them – causing her to be sick – and a teacher twice reported him to the head. Another member of staff saw Leat projecting an indecent image of an adult on to a wall during a lesson. Leat was also seen lifting up and groping young girls in the playground, tickling and cuddling pupils in class and sitting on cushions with a schoolgirl while visibly aroused. But those staff members who reported Leat’s behaviour were told they should not ‘insinuate things’ and were bullied into silence, a report said yesterday. It was later discovered that Leat would routinely hide a camera under his desk and then summon his victims, recording the subsequent horrifying images of the abuse. In many of the videos, which are up to ten minutes in length, other children can be seen or heard in the background. When police finally became involved, Leat first denied wrongdoing but later admitted 36 sexual offences including rape, assault and voyeurism. Yesterday a review by the North Somerset Safeguarding Children Board concluded that his appalling crimes could have been stopped much earlier if the school had not failed to act on the warnings. Instead, out of 30 disturbing incidents noted, only 11 were mentioned to the school’s headmaster, Chris Hood, and none was passed on to an agency outside the school. Abuse: Leat worked at Hillside First School, in Weston-Super-Mare, where staff complained but were ignored . Leat was only arrested in December 2010, when a schoolgirl told her mother he abused her ‘every day apart from when the teaching assistant was in the classroom’. Police who raided the home he shared with his wife, also a teacher, found more than 30,000 images, including 61 pictures and 21 movies at level five, the most serious level. At least 20 children were victims of Leat’s abuse or witnessed it at the school, which caters for 128 children aged between four and eight. Three Ofsted inspections undertaken during the time Leat was abusing his students graded it as ‘good’ and a report in 2009 noted: ‘Pupils feel exceptionally safe and secure because they know that staff have their well-being at heart.’ Tony Oliver, who chaired the\\xa0 serious case review, said: ‘There was a failure at every level within the school. ‘There was a culture which just did not empower people to voice their concerns. It could be interpreted as a culture of bullying.’ He said the headmaster had\\xa0 been sacked following a disciplinary process.',\n",

In a statement, Foxconn Technology Group denied it was forcing anyone to work and said the students -- who constitute 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers -- \"are free to leave the internship program at any time.\" \"Foxconn has long had a short-term internship program that we carry out in cooperation with a number of vocational schools in China,\" the company said. The internship programs range in length from one to six months and students all are of legal age to work, the company added. An explainer on Foxconn . Foxconn\\'s statement follows claims by a Chinese labor group that many of the students weren\\'t given a choice by their schools whether to work on the assembly line. \"We think that this kind of internship is a sham and a kind of forced labor or involuntary work,\" said Debby Chan, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong-based Students & Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior (SACOM). \"The placement to work must be relevant to studies and the students must find it beneficial.\" The group had interviewed students from a vocational school who were required to do internships at Foxconn\\'s Zhengzhou plant even before the students started first year classes, Chan said. The allegations follow a report last week by state-run China Daily that claimed vocational schools in Huai\\'an in Jiangsu province were making students work at a Foxconn plant making USB data lines for the new iPhone 5. Education, English, food science and finance majors were among those required to do paid assembly line internships. \"I don\\'t think we can improve our skills through that \\'internship\\' the schools are requiring,\" one student told China Daily. Apple has scheduled an event for Wednesday, anticipated to be the release of its latest iPhone. Foxconn is part of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., one of the world\\'s largest suppliers of components for the electronics industry. Much of its manufacturing division is based in mainland China, where it assembles a range of products including Apple\\'s iPhone and iPad, Amazon\\'s Kindle and Microsoft\\'s Xbox. \"A recent audit of three of our facilities in China carried out by the Fair Labor Association confirmed that there was no evidence to indicate that any of the interns were pressured to participate in or to continue to participate in any internship program,\" Foxconn said in a statement. \"A previous audit by the Fair Labor Association confirmed that students find their participation in this program valuable and that the positions offered by Foxconn were at compensation levels equivalent to entry-level full-time workers.\" The Fair Labor Association released a report last month that Foxconn has moved to bring working hours -- including overtime -- down to below 60 hours per week \"with the goal of reaching full compliance with the Chinese legal limit of 40 hours per week, plus an average of 9 hours of overtime per week while protecting worker compensation.\" \"Immediate health and safety measures\" had been made, such as enforcement of breaks, changing equipment design to reduce repetitive stress injuries and testing of emergency equipment like eyewashes and sprinklers, the August report said. Foxconn has been at the center of a storm of complaints about working conditions for its Chinese staff after a 2010 spate of worker suicides at its plants. Foxconn said it had increased workers pay, introduced counselors, started a 24-hour phone counseling service and opened a stress room where workers can take out frustration on mannequins with bats. An explosion last year at a Foxconn plant that makes Apple\\'s iPad2 in Chengdu killed four people and injured 18 more. Chinese officials said the blast may have been caused by combustible dust in a polishing workshop. That incident followed a report by SACOM alleging that workers at the same plant do not have adequate training in the use of chemicals and do not have regular on the job health checks. \"While we provide vocational schools with our qualification requirements, it is the schools that recruit the students under the supervision of the relevant local government and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship program,\" Foxconn said on its use of interns. \"In addition to allowing the students to gain relevant industry experience while earning the same industry-competitive compensation as our full-time entry-level workers, this program gives Foxconn an opportunity to identify participants in the internship program who have the potential to be excellent full-time employees should they wish to join our company upon graduation from their vocational school.\" Police, company investigates Foxconn death .',\n",

Britain \\'damned well shouldn\\'t\\' be forced by European judges to give prisoners the vote if Parliament decides they should be barred from elections, David Cameron warned today. In a strongly-worded attack on interference from Strasbourg, the Prime Minister called for the European Court of Human Rights to have its wings clipped. The defiant remarks put the government on a collision course with judges who have ruled that the Britain\\'s blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights. Warning: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured leaving a cafe in Kirby Stephen where he stopped for lunch during a tour of the north east, vowed to stand up to Strasbourg . Defiant: David Cameron, who tweeted this picture, told workers at a Tetley tea factory in Stockton-on-Tees that Parliament should over-rule Strasbourg . Mr Cameron spoke out during a question and answer session at a Tetley tea factory in Stockton-on-Tees. The ECHR has announced it is . reopening 2,281 compensation claims by UK prisoners. In February last year the Commons called for the blanket ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22, despite repeated warnings from Strasbourg. Since then ministers have published a draft bill on the issue, while stressing that the UK Parliament is ‘sovereign’ and it was up to MPs to decide whether or not to comply with ECHR rulings. Mr Cameron said: \\'If Parliament decides that prisoners should not get the vote then I think they damn well shouldn\\'t.\\' He added: \"It should be a national decision taken in our Parliament.\\' Work: Mr Cameron traveled by train to Darlington for the PM Direct event where he called for the ECHR to have its wings clipped . The PM said the court\\'s powers must be restricted, telling workers \\'we need to clip its wings\\'. Earlier this month Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption compared the behaviour of the Strasbourg court on prisoner voting to the activities of communist East Germany. ‘To give the force of law to values for which there is no popular mandate is democratic only in the sense that the old German Democratic Republic was democratic,’ he said. But a week ago Lady Hale, the deputy president of the Supreme Court and the most senior woman among the judiciary, said European judges did have the right to overrule Parliament on the issue. She said Strasbourg human rights judges must step in to protect prisoners because MPs will not do the job. The prisoner voting row has been running since 2005, when Strasbourg judges ordered Britain to give the vote to convicted prisoners, who have historically been considered to have removed themselves from the electorate. Despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the Commons, the European judges have continued to repeat their instructions. In 2010 Mr Cameron said it makes him \\'physically ill\\' to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison. And in October last year he added: \\'No one should\\xa0 be under any doubt - prisoners are not getting\\xa0 the vote under this government.\\'',\n",

Award-winning actress Samantha Morton is set to speak to police over claims she suffered sexual abuse at the hands of care home workers. The Golden Globe and Bafta winner, who spent most of her childhood living in institutions in Nottingham, spoke out last month saying she was abused by two male residential home workers when she was just 13. She said that the abuse was reported to both the police and social services but neither was investigated. Now the 37-year-old has agreed to be formally interviewed by officers, who could be set to launch an investigation after the claims surrounding the now closed Red Tile Home in Nottinghamshire. The actress had previously revealed she had recently spoken to Nottinghamshire Police about her original complaint and was told the report contained only a reference to 'frolicking' and no sexual abuse. However, a force spokesman today confirmed: 'We have agreed a date and time towards the end of this month to meet with the individual concerned to discuss the matter.' The double-Oscar nominee said she decided to waive her right to anonymity in the wake of a report detailing sexual exploitation of 1,400 children over a period of 16 years in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. She told the Guardian that she was subjected to abuse by two different perpetrators during her time in care, but was too embarrassed to report her plight straight away. She explained: 'I was embarrassed and the people that did what they did to me... I thought they were really nice people, so I was actually really shocked when it happened.' The actress added: 'I just wanted to go public with this, to say, we know it's rife but why are there not further investigations into other areas? It isn't just Rotherham, I'm sure it's not just Rotherham. Miss Morton at an awards ceremony, left, and in a TV \\xa0adaptation of Jane Eyre, right. The actress said she was subjected to abuse by two different male workers at the Red Tiles Home in Nottinghamshire, which is now closed . 'A lot of people who abused my friends were people in very, very top jobs within the social services. Nottingham in the 80s was rife with that.' Police are also said to be looking into claims about historic abuse at nine homes across Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. A Nottinghamshire County Council spokesman has also said they were hoping to speak to Miss Morton about her concerns. The actress, pictured in the film In America,\\xa0said she decided to waive her right to anonymity in the wake of a report detailing sexual exploitation of 1,400 children in Rotherham . In 2009 the double Oscar-nominee, who also starred alongside Tom Cruise in Minority Report, backed a Government campaign to recruit social workers in the wake of the Baby P scandal. Speaking then Miss Morton said she experienced some 'wonderful' social workers who supported her and helped her realise her ambitions. She said: ''My early life from infancy to leaving home at 16 was spent in care. I had some wonderful social workers who supported me and helped me achieve my goals in life. 'There are many people out there, whether they be children, families, vulnerable adults, even the aged who need a social worker.'\",\n",

Iain Conn, the new chief executive of British Gas’s parent company Centrica, said the group would not pass on the falling cost of energy to customers until 2016. The price of oil has more than halved since last summer, while gas – the main source of electricity in Britain – has dropped by 29 per cent. But power firms have reduced their prices only modestly. Britain's largest power boss claims households will not see a ‘meaningful’ drop in energy bills until next year . British Gas will cut its prices by 5 per cent at the end of this month. EDF has trimmed rates by just 1.3 per cent, while SSE has been ridiculed for refusing to introduce its 4.1 per cent cut until the end of April. Mr Conn, who is on a £3.7 million pay deal at Centrica, said the power giant would not lower prices again because it had bought all of its current energy in advance almost two years ago when prices were much higher. He said that bills ‘will not come down unless energy prices continue to stay down’. It means that power tariffs in 2016 ‘will be much more meaningfully impacted’ by the current fall in prices, he added. This is what critics feared when Ed Miliband pledged to freeze prices for two years if Labour wins power at the election in May. The policy has been widely criticised, and experts say many energy companies would have cut their tariffs sooner if the threat was not in place. Critics have also warned that the move would sap investment from Britain. Yesterday the Centrica group reported a 35 per cent fall in its profits – but still made £1.75 billion last year. British Gas’s profits from supplying households with power fell 23 per cent to £463 million, largely because of warm weather last year and customers switching to smaller suppliers. Almost 400,000 abandoned British Gas during the year. Iain Conn, the new chief executive of British Gas’s parent company Centrica, said the group would not pass on the falling cost of energy to customers until 2016 . Mr Conn said British Gas made an average of £42 profit per customer. The energy regulator Ofgem has previously said the true figure for large energy providers was £114. The Centrica group blamed the falling price of oil and the warm weather for its drop in profits. It took the controversial decision to cut its dividend to shareholders by 30 per cent. This particularly hit its 650,000 small shareholders, many of whom have owned shares since the company was privatised by Margaret Thatcher in 1986. Centrica also said it would cut spending on oil projects in the North Sea by up to 40 per cent. Ann Robinson, consumer policy director at the price comparison website uSwitch dismissed Mr Conn’s defence of his tariffs. She said: ‘If that’s how Centrica are buying and trading their energy then they are quite frankly inefficient.’ Richard Lloyd, executive director at the consumer group Which? said: ‘The modest price cuts have done little to convince consumers that they’ve had the full benefit of a significant shift in wholesale costs.’ Mr Conn’s remarks come only a day after the competition watchdog warned that loyal energy customers were paying too much. The Competition and Markets Authority said that families who stayed on default tariffs paid £234 a year more than those who switch to cheaper rates.\",\n",

Oil prices have more than halved since last summer, and gas prices have dropped by 29%, but energy companies have only modestly reduced their prices. British Gas will cut its prices by 5% at the end of the month, while EDF has trimmed rates by 1.3%, and SSE will introduce a 4.1% cut at the end of April. Conn explained that Centrica bought its current energy supply almost two years ago when prices were higher, and bills will only come down if energy prices remain low. Critics argue that the threat of a price freeze by Labour, if elected, has deterred companies from cutting prices sooner. Centrica reported a 35% fall in profits to £1.75 billion, with British Gas’s household supply profits dropping 23% to £463 million, partly due to warm weather and customer defections. The company also cut its dividend to shareholders by 30%, affecting 650,000 small shareholders. Consumer groups have criticized',\n",

The office received 3,784 child abuse reports last year, up from only 425 complaints in 2007, a significant increase for a nation with a population of about 2.8 million. OCR Registrar Carla Edie told the Jamaican government news service, JIS, that the people of Jamaica have become \"increasingly mindful of their legal responsibility to report such incidents,\" and are increasingly concerned about child safety, given a recent trend of violence against minors in the country. According to JIS, a police report issued late last year said that, between January 1, 2008 and November 1, 2008, 73 children were murdered and 383 cases of carnal abuse were reported. Flogging and other forms of physical abuse are a part of Jamaican culture, Justice Minister Dorothy Lightbourne told JIS in an interview. \"There are many parents who even threaten to \\'murder\\' their children, even some as young as two years old,\" Lightbourne said. Regarding official child abuse reports, Edie also said that the large increase can be attributed to growing awareness that the Office of Children\\'s Registry is the department responsible for tracking and acting on such information, and not other government and police agencies that handled those reports in the past. In addition, \"if someone has information of suspected child abuse and fails to make a report to the Registry, that person can be charged a maximum fee of $500,000 or-and six months imprisonment,\" Edie told JIS.

Alan Irvine has overseen a fourth successive loss, as the relegation places loom closer. Fan chants told his story too. ‘Taxi for Irvine,’ the home crowd shouted. They have seen their team win only three times in the Premier League this calendar year. Irvine said: ‘It’s not going to help but I can’t control that, the fans have every right to behave in every way they chose. 'I’ve said we are a lot stronger if everybody is pulling in the same direction. 'It comes with the territory. It’s not that long since Sam went through it.’ Irvine evidently lacks full confidence in his squad players to alter starting line-ups much. Summer signing Silvestre Varela was brought on in the second half for only his second appearance of the season. Striker Brown Ideye, who cost £9million, came on with six minutes to go for his first outing since late October. It is quite the opposite for Allardyce, who won here without starting Enner Valencia or the injured Diafra Sakho – two players who lit up West Ham’s opening games. Kevin Nolan scored his first goal since February on his return to the side, while James Tomkins found the winner with a header on the stroke of half-time. Craig Dawson had given Albion an early lead but the high spirits soon faded. ‘Our summer months of hard work in recruiting terms and pre season are still paying off for us,’ said Allardyce. ‘It wasn’t great but it was resilient.

CLICK HERE to view our\\xa0brilliant\\xa0Match Zone including the move for Kevin Nolan's equaliser against West Brom . West Brom took the lead in the 10th minute when Victor Anichebe turned Tomkins and earned a free-kick on the angle of the area. Graham Dorrans whipped across a devious ball, but it was far too simple for Dawson to bound into the six-yard area, past Tomkins, and find a glancing header into the net. Given Albion’s last goal came virtue of the rather unfortunate Esteban Cambiasso in victory at Leicester, this broke a run of 370 minutes since someone on the payroll had scored. It was reward for a bright start, but near enough straight away the hosts began to sit back. West Ham needed no invitation to attack. By half-time the visitors were ahead. Nolan, at 32, is less of a fixture in Allardyce’s side than he once was but he still possesses an uncanny ability at close range. In the 35th minute Stewart Downing flung a free-kick into the area. Chris Brunt only cleared Tomkins’ header into the air and Andy Carroll connected in spectacular fashion with a bicycle kick that flew at goal. Ben Foster sprang to save but Nolan had ghosted into the six-yard box and nodded the rebound in – his first goal since February 22. On the stroke of half-time Brunt was forced off injured and West Ham went ahead. Foster pushed a shot from Cheikhou Kouyate round the post to concede a corner. Downing flighted it deep and Tomkins out-leapt Dawson to head home. A role reversal of earlier – and far too easy again. Dawson had a chance to atone seven minutes after the interval, but dragged his shot horribly wide. Then, just as they did against Arsenal, West Brom roused to rally in the final 10 minutes. Anichebe found space in the box and drove a shot at goal that Adrian saved with his legs, then Dorrans hit a volley that flashed just wide. Once again, it was too little, too late.

              "  {'content': 'The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for legal same-sex marriages in five more states. The court refused to hear cases from the states -- Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin -- seeking to keep their same-sex marriage bans in place. Couples in some of those states began applying for marriage licenses just hours after the Supreme Court\\'s decision. CNN affiliate WVEC in Norfolk, Virginia, captured a same-sex couple who rushed to fill out their marriage license documents. Officials in Virginia began issuing same-sex marriage licenses at 1 p.m. Monday. Tony London and Tim Bostic, two plaintiffs in Norfolk, said they were ready to receive their marriage license Monday afternoon. \"It was a pleasure suing you,\" London joked when a clerk handed him the license, a WVEC reporter tweeted, capturing the two locked in a kiss. In Richmond, Lindsey Oliver and Nicole Pries left work and drove to the John Marshall Courthouse, where they were the first same-sex couple to be married. \"It\\'s a great thing,\" Oliver told CNN affiliate WTVR. \"There\\'s lot of things that need to be done in Virginia to still make gays equal. This is one step and we\\'re glad to be a part of it.\" Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said all of the state\\'s 54 county clerks must start issuing same-sex marriage licenses. A similar order could be issued by day\\'s end for Indiana and Wisconsin. \"Supreme Court\" trended on Twitter with dozens of people weighing in -- and trying to figure out exactly what the high court\\'s move meant. Experts say its refusal to hear the cases from those five states also means that six more states -- Colorado, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kansas, West Virginia, and Wyoming -- could soon have to lift their bans on same-sex marriage, because they are covered by the same circuit appeals courts that initially struck down the prohibitions. Once that happens, the number of states permitting same-sex marriage would jump from 19 to 30. At issue is whether gay and lesbian couples in all 50 states have the same equal protection or due process right to marry that opposite-sex couples have. The Family Research Council, a conservative public policy and lobbying organization, said voters were having their rights infringed. \"Unfortunately, by failing to take up these marriage cases, the high court will allow rogue lower court judges who have ignored history and true legal precedent to silence the elected representatives of the people and the voice of the people themselves by overturning state provisions on marriage,\" Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said. In Utah, just hours after word from the high court came down, Gov. Gary Herbert said at a press conference that he felt \"surprised\" and \"disappointed\" that there was no \"finality\" on the issue of same-sex marriage. The state would comply with Monday\\'s order, he said, and same-sex marriages would move forward. \"Regardless of your personal beliefs,\" he urged, \"... please treat each other with respect and with kindness as we transition through this new law.\" The court\\'s action does not mean there won\\'t eventually be a final ruling on the constitutional questions -- many court observers fully expect a landmark decision in the next year or two -- but it does signal the justices are not ready to jump into the politically charged debate right now. The high court\\'s move surprised many observers. Advocates on both sides of the issue had wanted the court to offer a definitive, binding ruling on key constitutional questions. \"The question of whether same-sex marriage bans are constitutional is a historic issue, under the Constitution and for the Roberts Court,\" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a respected Washington attorney. \"It\\'s hard to imagine a situation where judges are going to have more power to define the social and family relationships of the country.\" He\\'s referring to Chief Justice John Roberts. Both sides passionate . Same-sex marriage is already legal in the District of Columbia and 19 U.S states: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. A Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage would essentially end a patchwork of state laws -- some that allow it, some that prohibit it, and a few that allow protections short of marriage, such as civil unions and domestic partnerships. Marriage equality supporters cheered the high court\\'s Monday order. \"Today\\'s decision by the Supreme Court leaves in force five favorable marriage rulings reached in three federal appellate courts, ensuring the freedom to marry for millions more Americans around the country,\" said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry. \"But we are one country, with one Constitution, and the court\\'s delay in affirming the freedom to marry nationwide prolongs the patchwork of state-to-state discrimination and the harms and indignity that the denial of marriage still inflicts on too many couples in too many places.\" The Supreme Court hurried to schedule the appeals from the five states for its closed-door conference, even before all the legal briefs had been filed. But the justices offered no explanation of why they are not ready to resolve the issue. Some conservative activists say the high court should stay out of same-sex marriage issues. \"When the court on such an issue -- where there are very strong opinions on both sides, and a huge issue of social change in our country -- steps in and makes it into a constitutional issue, it makes the justices look significantly more political in the eyes of the American people,\" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network. \"It would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the court ... by imposing one type of solution for the entire nation, instead of leaving it in the hands of the states to decide how they want to address this issue.\" Many supporters of \"traditional\" marriage privately say preserving an inflexible one-man/one-woman definition of wedlock nationwide would not be realistic moving forward, and that a divided bloc of states upholding the status quo may be the best possible scenario. But all that hinges on what the Supreme Court does. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, the first state attorney general to argue successfully at the district and appeals level for a marriage ban to be struck down, said \"a new day has dawned, and the rights guaranteed by our Constitution are shining through.\" Same-sex precedent . A federal appeals court in August took just nine days after intensive oral arguments to issue its sweeping conclusion that voter-approved same-sex marriage bans in Indiana and Wisconsin were unacceptably discriminatory. And state leaders then took just five days to formally ask the Supreme Court to intervene. Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently hinted that a \"Why wait?\" attitude may predominate. \"I think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation,\" she told The Associated Press in July, referring to interracial marriage, a ban on which was not struck down by the high court until 1967. \"If a case is properly before the court, they will take it.\" It takes just four of the nine justices to put such petitions on the docket -- but five, of course, to ultimately prevail on the merits. State and federal judges in the past year have ruled 39 times in favor of the expanded marriage right, while two have upheld existing laws. All this follows what the Supreme Court in 2013 said peripherally on the issue. Fifteen months ago, the justices cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume after it ruled private parties did not have \"standing\" to defend a voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. More importantly, the high court also rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in its 5-4 \"Windsor\" decision, citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits, such as tax breaks. That federal question now morphs into the higher-stakes state jurisdiction, where marriage laws have traditionally been controlled, and where the equal protection issues will ultimately be resolved. By CNN\\'s count, various individuals and gay rights groups have launched more than 80 pending marriage equality lawsuits in all 31 states with current bans. A Supreme Court review would put all that litigation on hold. However, the nine justices had complete discretion to stand on the sidelines for now and wait for a majority of these state battles to play out, or for a federal appeals court to uphold a ban.

Gatwick Airport bosses flew into a storm with protesters today when they announced plans for a controversial second runway at Britain’s second biggest airport. It could double capacity at the West Sussex airport to 70million. It currently handles 34million passengers a year flying to 200 destinations in 90 countries. Under a legal agreement made in 1979, the airport cannot build a second runway before 2019 – and decision makers at Gatwick insist they will honour that agreement. Gatwick's future? If these proposals for a second runway are approved, the number of annual flights at the airport will soar from 250,000 to 500,000 . Twice the flights: Gatwick's capacity could double to 70million if the plans are approved. Protesters say the second runway will hit the region's infrastructure hard . But after that all bets are off and Gatwick bosses say they are beginning detailed work now on the option for an additional new runway, which could be built in the next decade. They say a second runway at Gatwick is a better option to boost Britain’s aviation than a third runway at Heathrow, the expansion of Stansted or a multi-billion ‘Boris Island’ option of a new airport in the middle of the Thames Estuary, as favoured by\\xa0 London Mayor Boris Johnson and others. But the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign (GACC) has blasted the plans - and claimed the announcement was being made to drive up the value of the airport's owners. GACC chairman Brendon Sewill said: 'We have always been . totally opposed to a new runway on environmental grounds, and have had . massive support from across Surrey, Sussex and west Kent. 'We have been supported by all the local MPs and all the county, . district and parish councils in a wide area. 'If necessary, we will . resume the battle. We will fight it all the way. We’ve done so before. We will do so again.' Brendon Sewill of the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign has vowed to fight the second runway. Villagers in nearby Charlwood fear environmental damage, heavier traffic, more noise and plummeting house prices . The GACC also released a statement . that said: ‘We stand ready, if need be, to launch a massive campaign to . defeat any new runway plan, as we have defeated such plans in the past. 'It . would mean twice as many planes in the sky, twice the noise, twice the . local pollution, twice the number of airport-related cars, and twice the . climate change damage. Twice as many airport workers would need twice . as many houses.' Alternative: Gatwick claims the plan is a superior option to proposed expansion at Heathrow or Stansted or a new site in central London . Gatwick was owned by Heathrow operator . BAA until it sold the Sussex airport in December 2009 for £1.5billion to . the consortium Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) – owners of London . City Airport – following a highly critical report by the Competition . Commission attacking BAA’s dominance in the South East. The . Gatwick second runway option will be submitted as part of a . 'masterplan' to the Government-appointed aviation commission, led by . former Financial Services Authority (FSA) chief Sir Howard Davies, which . will make its full report in summer 2015. Gatwick chief executive Stewart . Wingate defended the plan, saying a new runway at the airport could be . 'affordable and practical' and was a better option than new runways at . Heathrow or Stansted. He confirmed that a second runway would double passenger numbers to 70,000 and annual flights from 250,000 to 500,000. It would take four to five years from . August 2019 to build the second runway and associated terminal . buildings – meaning the earliest it could open would be about 2023. Mr Wingate told the Daily Mail that . GIP, which owns 42 per cent of Gatwick, had been ‘quite clear’ when it . bought the airport three years ago that it would keep its holding for a . limited period of between five and 10 years before selling. That could take it up to 2019 when work on a new runway could begin. Mr Wingate said: ’This was a decision by all the shareholders for the long-term interests of Gatwick.’ Plans for the future will evaluate various runway options and assess key requirements, including environmental, surface access and economic impacts. It will also look at environmental issues including noise and air quality impacts on local communities. Gatwick chiefs believe that the additional capacity, flexibility and 'resilience', or the ability to operate without long delays and cancellations caused by lack of staff or poor weather, that could be provided by a new runway at Gatwick will help to ensure that London's airports provide south-east England and the UK with the connectivity needed. Gatwick Airport is the UK’s second largest airport and the busiest single-runway airport in the world. It serves around 200 destinations in 90 countries for around 34 million passengers a year on short- and long-haul point-to-point services. A second runway would double passenger number to around 70million a year. Gatwick generates around 23,000 airport jobs and a further 13,000 jobs through related activities. The airport is 28 miles south of London and owned by a group of international investment funds, of which Global Infrastructure Partners is the largest shareholder. Gatwick serves more destinations than any other UK airport flying to 197 destinations compared with 163 destinations from Heathrow (Source: OAG data). It is the UK’s largest short haul airport serving 145 destinations, excluding UK, compared with 73 destinations from Heathrow (Source: based on peak week summer 12 OAF scheduled data). It is the UK’s largest domestic airport serving 12 destinations compared with seven destinations from Heathrow (Source: based on peak week summer 12 OAF scheduled data). A 1979 legal agreement with West Sussex Council prohibits Gatwick from constructing a new runway before 2019. The Government’s failure to consider Gatwick's expansion a decade ago because of this agreement forced ministers to re-run a previous consultation on airport expansion following a legal challenge. Gatwick was owned by Heathrow operator BAA until it sold the Sussex airport in December 2009 for £1.5billion to the consortium Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) – owners of London City Airport – following a highly critical report by the Competition Commission attacking BAA’s dominance in the South East. Gatwick is built on the site of an ancient manor house which became home to a racecourse in the 19th century. In the late 1920s land next to the racecourse was used as an aerodrome and in the 1930s became home to the Surrey Aero Club. In 1933: The Air Ministry approved commercial flights from Gatwick. Bosses said that at least for the rest of this decade, London's airports will be relying on their existing physical capacity. Gatwick's submission to the Davies Commission will also include a detailed evaluation of how Gatwick's existing single runway capacity can be maximised to contribute to the short-term capacity needs for London and the UK. Mr Wingate said: 'I believe a new runway at Gatwick could be affordable, practical and give passengers a greater choice of routes to key markets. 'A new runway will allow Gatwick to compete and grow, increasing the choice available to passengers today. We have the space, capability and access to financial resources.' He noted: 'Over the last three years we have transformed the airport, invested around £650 million and have a strong track record for delivering key routes to growth markets. 'However, we must now look to the future when Gatwick will become full and outline its long-term role in ensuring London has an efficient and resilient airport system that creates the crucial connectivity London and the UK needs.' He insisted: 'There are clear practical advantages of a new runway at Gatwick. When compared with a third runway at Heathrow, we would have a significantly lower environmental impact whilst adding significantly more capacity. 'Stansted is half empty today, we already have much better surface transport links and feel our business case will be much stronger.' Taking a swipe at the 'Boris Island' options for the Thames Estuary Mr Wingate noted: 'As for the Estuary airport there are major questions on affordability, environmental issues and whether they are deliverable. 'The process of evaluating the runway options will be complex. I am committed to undertaking a comprehensive and in-depth assessment that considers not only the economic benefits but also the environmental impacts. We will be consulting with our key stakeholders throughout the process.' A statement from Gatwick Airport insisted: 'Our submission to the Commission will be consistent with Gatwick’s commitment to the 1979 legal agreement with West Sussex Council. That agreement prohibits Gatwick from constructing a new runway before 2019.' The Government’s failure to consider . Gatwick expansion a decade ago because of this agreement forced . ministers to re-run a previous consultation on airport expansion . following a legal challenge. Baroness Jo Valentine, chief executive of London First, also praised the plans. She said: ‘Anything that could increase runway capacity at London’s airports is good news for passengers and for the UK economy. 'If the UK is going to remain a competitive economy, we need more flights to growing and emerging markets. This announcement from London Gatwick broadens the debate on how we can achieve that and offers the potential for further competition and greater choice for passengers.' Officials at Heathrow Airport added there voice to those objecting to the second runway. A . spokesman said: 'The UK is not short of the point to point capacity . provided by airports like Gatwick – there is already plenty of spare . point to point capacity at Stansted, Birmingham and Luton. 'What . the UK is short of is hub airport capacity. Hub airports use transfer . passengers to pool demand from different countries – and all the . evidence suggests this is the only way to support the frequent and . direct long haul routes that are vital to business and trade.' Fears: People living near the airport are worried that they will be forced to move, but aviation bosses say the plans are practical . Major scheme: Gatwick is the UK's second largest airport and the busiest single-runway airport in the world .\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"Gatwick Airport has announced plans for a second runway, which could double its capacity to 70 million passengers annually and increase annual flights from 250,000 to 500,000. The proposal, which cannot be implemented before 2019 due to a 1979 legal agreement, is part of a broader plan to boost Britain's aviation sector. Gatwick's chief executive, Stewart Wingate, argues that a second runway at Gatwick is a more practical and affordable option compared to expanding Heathrow or building a new airport in the Thames Estuary. However, the plan faces strong opposition from local conservation groups, such as the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign (GACC), which cites environmental concerns, increased noise, and potential negative impacts on local infrastructure and property values. The proposal will be submitted to the government-appointed aviation commission, led by Sir Howard Davies, which is expected to report in summer 2015. Supporters, including London First, argue that increased runway capacity is essential for the UK's economic competitiveness, while critics, including Heathrow Airport, contend that the UK needs more hub airport capacity rather than additional point-to-point services.\",\n",

It took four days (three of which were spent almost completely on a plane), and he accrued 270,000 miles. He admits that the journey was exhausting, but ultimately worth it. \"To put it into some kind of perspective, it\\'s enough miles for two first-class tickets between the U.S. and Asia,\" he notes. \"If I would have paid cash for them, they would have each cost me over $20,000.\" December -- which marks the last opportunity for many frequent fliers to earn enough to gain (or maintain) their elite statuses -- is mile-run season. In the past, the trick was looking for a cheap ticket that went the distance, as miles earned were calculated by, well, miles flown. This year, that is all set to change. \"In 33 years of frequent flier programs, this is the year of the biggest changes ever,\" says Randy Petersen, founder of the online travel forum FlyerTalk and CEO of Frequent Flyer Services, which offers guidance to road warriors the world over. \"Some of the world\\'s largest frequent flier programs are going to a revenue model,\" he explains, noting that come this year, many programs will start awarding members based on how much they spend, not how far they fly. Air New Zealand started the trend when it introduced Airpoint Dollars in 2004. Other airlines have followed suit over the years, such as Virgin Australia, JetBlue and Southwest (the latter -- which awards members 10 points for every dollar spent -- has one of the most popular frequent flier programs in the U.S.). Starting this month, both Delta and United shifted to a completely revenue-based system of calculating miles earned. Petersen predicts it\\'s only a matter of time before the European carriers follow suit. \"They may say they won\\'t, because they don\\'t want to upset things, but these (carriers) are part of alliances. Over the next two years, I think you\\'ll start to see revenue-based frequent flier programs tremble out through the rest of the airline industry.\" Petersen notes there\\'s also been a shift in hotel awards programs. \"A lot of hotel programs are changing what it costs per night come January. If you\\'re planning on redeeming hotel rooms later this year, do it now. Get the redemptions at lower prices,\" he advises. As for points earned and spent on plane tickets, there\\'s little to be done but to accept airlines\\' change in policy. \"It\\'s too late for you to do anything. But here\\'s what you don\\'t do. Do not buy a more expensive ticket to earn miles. You\\'d be playing into what the airlines want. It\\'s okay to earn fewer miles on a cheap ticket, because you\\'ll still be able to find cheap awards out there,\" he says. More: Do frequent flier programs breed loyalty?',\n",

              "  {'content': \"By . Ray Massey . More than one in five drivers say they have been penalised because they do not understand 'confusing' parking signs . More than one in five motorists have had their cars ticketed, clamped or towed away because of ‘confusing’ parking signs. Some drivers avoid trying to park in areas where the signs are most prevalent, the poll by car insurers Churchill found. More than four out of ten of the 2,001 people polled said parking signs in their area were confusing, while a third avoided parking in their local town or city centre for this very reason. Almost one in ten even don’t risk parking near their home because of confusing signs. More than a quarter say areas near their home have multiple restrictions in place on the same street and almost a third think signs in their local authority area do not clearly indicate to which area the restrictions refer. Drivers avoiding parking in town centres due to sign confusion was most rife in London where nearly half of motorists admitted not even attempting to park in the heart of the UK capital. The next most shunned town centres are in the north west of England, followed by the east of England and south east England. Wales and north east England are the areas where motorists are most happy to attempt to park in town centres. The study says that overall a fifth of motorists have received a parking fine in the past two years as a result of not understanding the parking restrictions in that area. Some one in 20 of those have been clamped and one in 25 have had their vehicle towed away over the same period, as a result of parking sign confusion. Some drivers have endured one or more of these. Clamping on private land was outlawed two years ago but is still legal in certain circumstances by local authorities, the Government’s DVLA and bailiffs. In London alone last year some 8,273 cars were clamped on-street by local authorities, of which 8,167 were in Kensington and Chelsea, which is also the biggest for car tow-aways at 6,524. Churchill Car Insurance head Steve Barrett said: ‘It’s the driver’s responsibility to check which parking restrictions are in operation in a particular area. ‘However, when there are multiple restrictions in operation on a single street, it can result in motorists being confused and unintentionally parking illegally, incurring fines that could have been avoided.’ The findings come in the week that ministers announced that the use of CCTV ‘spy cars’ to catch people who park illegally is to be curtailed. They will no longer be allowed to routinely send out automatic tickets. Some one in 20 have been clamped and one in 25 have had their vehicle towed away over the past two years as a result of parking confusion, according to a poll by insurers Churchill . Instead parking wardens will instead have to fix tickets directly to windscreens, making it illegal for councils to issue penalties to drivers using just the CCTV spy cars currently used for on-street parking enforcement. However, councils will still be able to use the CCTV to issue postal tickets for any offences that occur on critical routes, such as those near schools and bus lanes, bus stops and on 'red routes'. The partial ban is being introduced following a three month to rein in 'over-zealous parking enforcement practices', which the Government says has forced people to shop in out-of-town centres or online, and give motorists and local shops a ‘fairer deal’. Ministers say the move will rein in ‘greedy councils’ who use the method of fining as a ‘cash cow’, and bring to an end the “plague” of tickets being issued by post.\",\n",

The ten bells at St Laurence Parish Church in Stroud, Gloucestershire, were chiming in a rare full peal as a gesture of goodwill to the local community. But the\\xa0relentless noise\\xa0was not appreciated by workers at The Shambles Market - which has been a permanent\\xa0fixture in the church's vicinity every Friday and Saturday since the 16th century. St Laurence Parish Church in Stroud, Gloucestshire, has received a letter of complaint after its bells chimed for three hours on Saturday . Andy Soutar, of the Global Organic fruit and vegetable stall which backs on to the church's gates, said: 'It went on for more than three hours. 'Apart from us not being able to think, there was a definite line in the market where people were not going. 'They just wouldn't go in to that space because of the noise.' Mr Soutar complained to the church after Saturday's three-hour bombardment but claims he is yet to receive a response. Local traders at The Shambles Market, which lies in the grand church's shadow, (the steeple can be seen in top left of picture) said their customers were being driven away by the deafening sound of continuous ringing . The Shambles Market in Stroud, Gloucestershire, features rows of outdoor stalls lined along The Shambles - the road which leads up to the church . He added: 'I am not against bell ringing or the church but this did go on for quite a long time and it affected trade. 'I hope some compromise can be found.' The next big peal was scheduled for November with a visiting bell-ringing team set to do the honours. A peal is the\\xa0name given to a specific type of performance of change ringing,\\xa0the art of ringing a set of tuned bells in a series of mathematical patterns. For a performance to be recognised as a peal it must consist of at least 5040 changes on up to seven working bells. The event has now been cancelled to the dismay of St Laurence's regular church-goers. Ron Cree, who runs the indoor market in St Laurence Church Hall, said he was not affected. He said: 'We could not really hear it inside. I heard that some market stall holders outside had written to the church because it got on their nerves a bit.' Team rector, Reverend Malcolm King and church wardens Deirdre Baker and Mike Lambert issued a statement in response. 'St Laurence Church has 10 bells - there are not many local churches with that number and of course the bells become popular for visiting bell ringers,' the statement read. 'On the morning of September 27 a visiting bellringer team managed to ring a full peal - quite an achievement in itself - which lasted for three hours and five minutes. 'This is the first time a full peel has been rung on a Saturday morning for quite a while. 'We understand that certain outside market stall holders found it difficult to hear for the length of time the peal was rung. 'It is a fact that church bells are of a certain volume so that they can be heard! 'As a goodwill gesture we have cancelled a peal that was to be rung by another visiting bellringer team on a Saturday morning in November. 'Any future peals for commemorations of events or ringing before or after religious services will take place as normal.' The market has been running on Fridays and Saturdays in the small Gloucestershire town since the 16th century .

              "  {'content': \"By . Wills Robinson . Resignation: Yingluck Shinawatra has been forced to step down after Thailand's Constitutional Court found her guilty of abuse of power . Thailand's prime minister has been forced to resign after the Constitutional Court found her guilty of abusing her power, pushing the country deeper into political turmoil. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, 46, was charged with abusing her authority by transferring a senior civil servant to another position in 2011. The court ruled that the transfer was carried out with a 'hidden agenda' to benefit her politically powerful family and, therefore, violated the constitution, an accusation she has denied. 'Transferring government officials must be done in accordance with moral principle,' the court said in its ruling. 'Transferring with a hidden agenda is not acceptable.' It is not immediately clear who will become the new acting prime minister. The ruling also forced out nine Cabinet members who the court said were complicit in the transfer of Thawil Pliensri from National Security Council Chief to a role in Yingluck's office. The verdict marks the latest dramatic twist in Thailand's long-running political crisis. It is a victory for Yingluck's opponents who for the past six months have been engaged in violent street protests demanding she step down to make way for an interim unelected leader. But it does little to resolve Thailand's political crisis as it leaves the country in limbo - and primed for more clashes. Since November, more than 20 have been killed and hundreds injured in demonstrations. The ruling also casts doubt on whether new elections planned for July will take place, which would anger Yingluck's mostly rural supporters who have called for a major rally in Bangkok on Saturday. Reaction: Anti-government supporters celebrate after hearing the news that Prime Minister Yingluck Sinawatra was forced to step down following a court ruling . Coverage: The judge, sitting in Bangkok, read out the verdict live on television . It also remains far from clear whether her opponents will be able to achieve other key demands, including creating a reform council overseen by a leader of their choice who will carry out various steps to rid the country of corruption and what they say is money politics, including alleged vote-buying. The campaign against Yingluck has been the latest chapter in Thailand's political upheaval that began when her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, was ousted by a 2006 military coup. It came after protestors accused him of corruption, abuse of power and disrespect for the constitutional monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Controversial: She was charged with abusing her authority in 2011 when she moved a civil servant to another position. Her supporters claim she has been the target of a 'judicial coup' Raising a glass: Protestors, who have been filling the streets and calling for Yingluck to be ousted for the last six months, toast their 'victory' The Constitutional Court in 2007 made . a landmark ruling dissolving Thaksin's original Thai Rak Thai party for . fraud in a 2006 election, and banned its executives from politics for . five years. Thaksin went into self-imposed exile in 2008 to escape a . two-year jail sentence for conflict of interest while prime minister. Thaksin's allies in late 2007 handily . won the first post-coup election, but the Constitutional Court in 2008 . kicked out two successive pro-Thaksin prime ministers. A coalition government then cobbled . together by the opposition Democrat Party had to use the army to put . down pro-Thaksin demonstrations in 2010 that left more than 90 people . dead in street battles, but Yingluck and her Pheu Thai party won a . sweeping majority in a mid-2011 general election. Yingluck's fortunes plunged when her . party's lawmakers last year used shady legislative tactics to try . to ram through a law that would have given an amnesty to political . offenders of the previous eight years, including Thaksin.

The gold-plated pen was given to Lord Mountbatten by his friend The Maharaja of Jodhpur in case he ever got into trouble. It remained with his family until recently when it was bought by an unknown collector in Yorkshire. Nicholas Holt holding the gold-plated pen which hides a secret pistol . But now the handmade pen - worthy of a James Bond-style scene - is due to be auctioned once again in March and is estimated to fetch between £5,000 and £7,000. Nicholas Holt, founder of Holt’s Auctioneers which is selling the item, said: 'The Maharaja of Jodhpur built it for his friend in case he got himself in a position where he had to sign something which he did not wish to sign - either to kill himself or the enemy.' The weapon was this week on display at Holt’s Auctioneers gun valuation day at Orvis, in West Park, Harrogate, North Yorkshire. Mr Holt said the deadly pen pistol would have been specially built for Mountbatten. The pen, also referred to as a pencil pistol, was built in 1948 and features a 2 3/4in smooth-bore barrel containing a removable propelling pencil mechanism with a concealed trigger. The outer body is inscribed with the words ‘Gun Shop Jodphur, 1948’. Present: The Maharaja of . Jodphur gave the pen to Lord Mountbatten for his protection . The gun will be sold by Norfolk-based Holt’s Auctioneers to be included in the sale of Fine Modern and Antique Guns at Princess Louise House, Hammersmith Road, London, on March 21. Mr Holt said any sale would be subject to strict laws governing the sale of arms and said he hoped that a museum might be interested in buying the item that has played such an important role in the nation’s history. When the item was last up for sale it was one of a number of military items that belonged to Lord Mountbatten, some of which he used during the Second World War. They reputedly helped to preserve his life. Old friends: Picture shows The Maharaja of Jodphur with Lord Mountbatten who gave his friend a gold plated pistol pen . The collection had been at the Imperial War Museum after legislation following the Dunblane massacre in 1996 banned the ownership of handguns. But Lord Mountbatten’s family later decided to sell the items. James Doyle, store manager at The Orvis Harrogate Store, said: 'It really is a fascinating little thing. 'This item I believe was a part of the mystique which went through that community which led to stories like the Bond stories.' Lord Mountbatten was a British statesman and naval officer, an uncle of the Duke of Edinburgh, and the last Viceroy of India.

Lord Mountbatten's coffin after he was killed in an IRA attack half a mile out of Mullaghmore Harbour in Ireland . He was killed by a bomb blast on his boat off the coast of Ireland.

Lord Mountbatten, who was 79 when he died, and his family had traditionally spent their summer holiday at their castle in County Sligo, north west of Ireland. They were aboard his boat, Shadow V, which had just set off from the fishing village of Mullaghmore, when the bomb detonated.\",\n",

Commuters have been given the chance to buy the house of their dreams - on the platform of a busy train station. It could be just the ticket for the lucky buyer who will be able to open their back door and walk straight onto their morning train to work at the unmanned station. Beat the commute: The lucky buyer will be able to open their back door and walk straight onto their morning train to work .

The Grade II-listed Victorian railway station house will be surrounded by commuters in the morning . The Grade II-listed Victorian railway station house sits on the main London to North Wales line where more than 20 trains stop every day. But the new purchaser is guaranteed at least six hour's undisturbed sleep - no trains run between midnight and 6am. Estate agent Hugh Steele-Perkins said: 'It is a commuter's dream house - you can step out of your bedroom and immediately be on the train. 'There's even a small window in the side of the property so you can see trains coming down the tracks. 'Just think - no more waiting on the platform on cold and wintery mornings.'

Penmaenmawr railway station serves the small town of and is located on the Crewe to Holyhead North Wales Coast Line. The station is a request stop. The line was built between 1844 and 1850 by the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company. It was of huge importance because in 1801, when the Act of Union was passed, all of Ireland became integrated with the United Kingdom. As mail had been exchanged on horse drawn cart and boats, a train would provide a speedier service for communication between Ireland and the United Kingdom. But whoever buys the £127,500 three-bedroomed house is going to be chuffed. Mr Steele-Perkins, director at Jacksons Commercial, in Llandudno, said: 'It's a busy station because it's on the main Euston to Holyhead line. 'It also has wonderful sea views from the top floor.' The station house which was built in 1850 has been used as an antiques shop with a three-bedroomed flat on the top floor since it was de-commissioned by British Rail in 1986. The property - built of heavy granite - has 2220 sq ft of floor space, two basement rooms and the former ground floor station ticket office and waiting rooms. Mr Steele-Perkins added: 'What the future holds for the station house is now in the hands of the buyer.

Now, 35 years later, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald has given Haverford College $25million back. Howard Lutnick, who lost 658 employees at the financial firm, including his younger brother, Gary,\\xa0in the 9/11 terror attacks, made the generous contribution to the college in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Handing over a check to president Daniel Weiss, the 53-year-old said: 'Haverford was there for me and taught me what it meant to be a human being.' Returning the favor: Howard Lutnick (pictured), 53, was given four years of free tuition after both of his parents died by his freshman year. Now, 35 years later, he has given Haverford College $25million back . College: Mr Lutnick, CEO and chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, made the generous contribution to the college (pictured) in Pennsylvania on Saturday. He said: 'Haverford taught me what it meant to be a human being' In response, Mr Weiss said the contribution, which is the largest single gift in the highly selective college's 181-year history, will be partly used to pay for much-needed library renovations. 'It's transformational, an overused word for sure, but not here,' said Mr Weiss, who presides over 1,200 students at the college, which prides itself on its Quaker heritage. Lutnick, who has been CEO of the New York City company since 1991 and chairman since 1996, was a senior in high school in Jericho when his 42-year-old artist mother, Jane, died of cancer (lymphoma). The following year, during his first week at Haverford, his father, Solomon, who taught at Queens College, passed away in hospital while being treated for colon and lung cancer. Generous: Haverford College president Daniel Weiss (right) said the contribution will be partly used to pay for much-needed library renovations. Left, Lutnick is pictured with his wife, Allison; they have four children . Paying tribute: On September 11, 2001, Lutnick (pictured at the 9/11 memorial) lost 658 employees at the financial firm in the  terror attacks. The firm was based in the World Trade Center's North Tower . A nurse treating the history professor had given him 100 times the dose of chemotherapy drugs that he was supposed to receive. The tragic mistake in 1979 left Lutnick and his brother orphaned. A week later, then-president of Haverford, Robert Stevens, called Lutnick and offered him a full scholarship for his degree in economics. 'Howard, your four years here are free', he told him. Lutnick, whose extended family had largely abandoned him, his brother and sister Edie, gratefully accepted the gift and went on to graduate in 1983, before joining Cantor Fitzgerald the same year. Speaking of the full scholarship, the businessman told\\xa0The Philadelphia Inquirer:\\xa0'Since I had only been at the school for a week, they couldn't possibly have known about me. Tragic: Lutnick's younger brother, Gary (pictured), passed away during the 9/11 terror attacks in New York . One of the attacks: Lutnick would have also died but he was taking his son to his first day of kindergarten . 'It was more about who they are as an institution than it was about me.' On September 11, 2001, Lutnick would have died with the rest of his employees in the World Trade Center's North Tower, but he was taking his son, Kyle, to his first day of kindergarten. Despite the majority of the company's 960 New York employees having perished, Lutnick made a risky decision - Cantor Fitzgerald would survive. In subsequent years, he rebuilt the firm into a global business with 8,000 employees, while giving 25 per cent of its profits - around $180million in total - to the families of 9/11 victims for five years. Siblings: Lutnick's extended family  largely abandoned him, his brother and sister Edie, following their parents' deaths. Above, Lutnich and his sister are pictured at Cantor Fitzgerald's annual charity day in 2013 . Lutnick, whose net worth is now an estimated $45million, and his employees continue to forgo a day's pay on September 11 each year and the company donates a day's revenue to charities. Over the past 25 years, Lutnick, who is the chairman of Haverford's board of managers and lives in New York City with his wife Allison and four children, has donated $65million to the school. The money has been used to build an indoor tennis and track center bearing his brother's name and an integrated athletic center in the name of his former best friend, Douglas Gardner, also a Cantor Fitzgerald employee who perished in the World Trade Center attacks. The funds - in particular, Saturday's record gift of $25million - have contributed greatly to the college's capital campaign, which aims to raise $225million by 2017.\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"Wolves returned to winning ways by beating promotion rivals Middlesbrough thanks to Bakary Sako’s cheeky penalty and Nouha Dicko’s brilliant solo goal. Boro hadn’t suffered defeat for seven Championship matches but were undone as Sako chipped in from 12 yards and Dicko dribbled through to slam into the roof of the net. It was a first win in five games for Kenny Jackett’s team as they moved to fourth, although there was a sour note as Sako picked up a groin injury and Dicko limped off with a dead leg. Wolves frontman Nouha Dicko is brought down in the area under the challenge of defender George Friend . Bakary Sako keeps his cool to chip his penalty from the spot to give Wolves the lead at Molineux . Sako's impressive 'Panenka' penalty set Wolves on their way to three points in Tuesday's Championship clash . Wolves (4-2-3-1): Ikeme 7; Doherty 6, Batth 7, Ebanks-Landell 7, Rowe 6; McDonald 7, Evans 6.5; Henry 7, Edwards 6.5, Sako 7 (Jacobs 63mins, 5.5); Dicko 7.5 (Clarke 78, 5). Subs not used: Flatt, Golbourne, Stearman,\\xa0Sagbo, Ricketts. Scorers: Sako (pen), 33, Dicko, 73. Booked: Ebanks-Landell. Middlesbrough (4-4-2): Konstantopoulos 6.5; Fredericks 6, Ayala 6, Omeruo 6, Friend 5; Adomah 7, Whitehead 6.5, Leadbitter 6.5, Reach 6 (Tomlin 65, 5); Vossen 6.5 (Wildschut 76, 5), Bamford 6.5 (Kike 65, 5.5). Subs not used:\\xa0Gibson, Nsue, Veljkovic, Mejias. Booked: Leadbitter. Attendance: 18, 391 . Referee: Carl Berry 6.5. Man of match: Nouha Dicko. Kenny Jackett rates Sako’s chances of making Saturday’s trip to Leeds at evens, but Dicko should recover in time. The pair are fast forming one of the Championship’s deadliest duos and now have 11 goals between them. Aitor Karanka was furious his side had failed to heed his warning about the pair. ‘I’m disappointed because the players lacked intensity and we knew their main dangers were Sako and Dicko,’ he said. Dicko’s goal 17 minutes from the end was reward for a fine performance. Collecting the ball from Dave Edwards on the left he cut in between two Boro defenders and finished emphatically. Dicko also won the penalty for the opening goal. Sako slipped the ball through to the 22-year-old on the edge of the box and in desperation to avert the danger George Friend got too close, giving Dicko reason to fall. Referee Carl Berry gave it. Sako stepped up and dinked a Panenka penalty that Andrea Pirlo would have been proud of. It was his seventh goal of the season. He is out of contract next summer and Wolves are anxious to tie down their star player. Of equal concern is the fact both players could be off to the African Cup of Nations in January to represent Mali. ‘We want forwards who have good reputations,’ said Jackett. Goalscorer Sako shows his delight at scoring and is congratulated by Wolves team-mate Dave Edwards . Wolves had been stuttering a little and dramatically collapsed in their last match at Millwall to draw from 3-0 up. Those late goals brought the total conceded in their previous four games to 11, having begun the campaign letting in only three in eight. They were much tighter last night. Boro did put Wolves under pressure after the opening goal, and Jackett was annoyed his team seemed to slack off. First Patrick Bamford set up Jelle Vossen, whose half-volley wasn’t the cleanest but looped over Ikeme and onto the crossbar. Then Vossen played in Bamford, who fired a strong shot that Ikeme punched to Vossen.

The Wolves’ goalkeeper almost allowed an equaliser after the interval, however, slipping as he caught Adomah’s cross and taking the ball perilously close to crossing the line. Boro appealed in vain. Wolves reacted and twice went close. Lee Evans somehow contrived to miss when James Henry’s free-kick from the left found him inside the six-yard box. Dave Edwards then sent his downwards header into the post from the same position when picked out by Henry from the other flank.

The win, which ended a four-game winless streak for Wolves, moved them to fourth place in the Championship. Sako's Panenka-style penalty in the 33rd minute and Dicko's impressive goal in the 73rd minute were the highlights of the match. However, the victory came at a cost, with both Sako and Dicko suffering injuries—Sako with a groin strain and Dicko with a dead leg. Middlesbrough, who had been unbeaten in their last seven matches, struggled to maintain their intensity, as manager Aitor Karanka criticized his team's lack of focus on the dangerous duo of Sako and Dicko. Despite some pressure from Boro, including a post-bound effort from Jelle Vossen, Wolves' defense held firm. The win was a significant boost for Wolves, who had previously conceded 11 goals in their last four games.\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'A British spy found dead at his home in 2010 -- his naked body padlocked inside a large red carrying bag stowed in the bathtub -- was either suffocated or poisoned, but it is unlikely his death will ever be satisfactorily explained, coroner Fiona Wilcox said Wednesday. Gareth Williams\\' death was \"unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated,\" she ruled. He probably entered the bag alive, Wilcox said, reading her ruling to a court around the corner from the home of the world\\'s most famous fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. But she was sure an unknown person put the bag containing his body into the bath and probably locked it, she said. The case has gripped the British public for more than a year and a half, since Williams, an MI6 agent known for his mathematical genius and codebreaking talent, was found dead at age 31 in August 2010. But after a weeklong inquest at which evidence from hundreds of expert witnesses, security camera images and police interviews was presented, the \"most fundamental questions as to how Gareth died remain unanswered,\" Wilcox said Wednesday. There was \"endless speculation but little real evidence,\" she said. And in unusual criticism of the Secret Intelligence Service, as MI6 is formally known, she said a delay in reporting his death and in providing relevant evidence added to the uncertainties about the case. Some of that evidence came to her only in the last 48 hours of the inquiry, Wilcox said. The coroner appeared briefly overcome with emotion as she came to the end of reading her ruling, her voice faltering as she announced her findings. The cause of death remains unknown, but experts agreed it was either from suffocation or poisoning, she said. \"I am therefore satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Gareth was killed unlawfully,\" she concluded. Among the theories aired by UK media were that Williams might have died at the hands of foreign intelligence agents or as a result of a kinky sexual encounter gone wrong, neither of which was supported by the evidence, the coroner said. She also cast doubt on suggestions that he was into bondage or transvestism, fueled by the discovery of women\\'s clothes, wigs and cosmetics in his apartment, saying she thought Williams bought them out of an interest in fashion, rather than any sexual motivation. Expressing her sympathies to his family, Wilcox said the inquest could not bring him back, but she hoped it had at least allowed them to see the evidence out in the open. A lawyer for Williams\\' family said that losing a much-loved son and brother would have been a tragedy in any circumstances but that the nature of Williams\\' death had made it all the worse. \"Our grief is exacerbated by the failure of his employers at MI6 to take even the most basic inquiries as to his whereabouts and welfare, which any reasonable employer would have taken,\" he said. \"We are also extremely disappointed at the reluctance and failure of MI6 to make available relevant information.\" The family has called for the Metropolitan Police to review the role of the intelligence services in the investigation. MI6 head John Sawers apologized \"unreservedly\" to Williams\\' family for the service\\'s failure to act more swiftly and said measures have been put in place to make sure it doesn\\'t happen again. The detective leading the police investigation, Jackie Sebire, said new lines of inquiry had resulted from the inquest and would now be \"actively pursued.\" \"His naked body was found in the most suspicious of circumstances,\" Sebire said. \"It is highly likely that a third party was involved in Gareth\\'s death, and I urge anyone who knew Gareth or who had contact with him to search their conscience and come forward with any information about what happened that night.\" Inside the court, a picture emerged of a man who had few friends but was very close to his family, highly intelligent and physically fit thanks to his love of cycling. A math prodigy who had completed his mathematics degree and master\\'s by the age of 21, he was someone who relished a challenge and had received an award for his \"world-class\" work for the intelligence services. Summing up the evidence, Wilcox said it was \"extremely unlikely,\" but not impossible, that Williams had worked out a technique to get into the bag -- measuring just 32 inches by 19 inches (81 by 48 centimeters) -- and lock it from the inside. But, she said, there was no evidence of footprints or handprints on the walls of the bathroom or the bath itself, as might have been expected if he had done that. He was not a risk taker, she said, and that made it unlikely in her view that he would have put himself into the bag even as a personal challenge without making sure he could get out. Of the four keys belonging to the padlock that secured the bag in which Williams was found, one pair was found inside it with him. A second pair was found on a key ring in his apartment, Wilcox said. There was no sign that evidence had been tampered with, such as traces of bleach. There was also no sign of a break-in or robbery in his neat, tidy apartment, she said. She described his body as \"peaceful\" and said there was no indication of a struggle. Wilcox also said there were no indications that Williams was feeling suicidal. However, tests that might have revealed unusual or volatile poisons were ruled out by the decomposition of the body. Traces of alcohol and a chemical matching the party drug GHB were found, but both can occur naturally as part of the decomposition process, she said. British media have reported that Williams\\' Internet history showed an interest in sex games and bondage, but Wilcox said the codebreaker had made only a handful of visits to bondage sites. The coroner said there was no evidence of interest in claustrophilia, a fetish for enclosure in very confined spaces. His apartment contained 20,000 pounds ($32,000) worth of high-fashion women\\'s clothing, unworn and packed as purchased, Wilcox said, but she said she found no connection between his death and his interest in fashion and women\\'s shoes and clothing. There also was no indication that his death was connected to his work, she said. He had not taken on any high-risk operations, and he worked only in the UK. There was no evidence of threats arising to him from his work, his employers testified. Wilcox was highly critical of Williams\\' line manager, who did not report that he was missing for about a week after he died August 16. She said the inability of the manager to recall certain key bits of evidence concerning the week of Williams\\' death \"is beginning to stretch the bounds of credibility.\" When questioned, the manager said he assumed Williams was absent for a legitimate reason that he had forgotten about, even though he missed several meetings. They worked on a small team of four people. The manager and other SIS employees testified from behind a screen and were identified only as SIS, plus a letter. Williams was finally reported missing by a co-worker August 23, more than a week after the normally punctilious employee had last shown up at work. \"I can only speculate as to what effect this had on this investigation,\" Wilcox said. The decomposition of Williams\\' body was hastened by the fact it was in a top floor apartment, where the temperature soared in the summer heat. The heating was mysteriously also turned on, despite it being a hot August, she said. Police did not secure the scene until eight or nine days after Williams died. Reports about the \"body-in-a-bag spy\" describe how two experts spent days trying to figure out whether Williams, who was athletic and of medium height, could have contorted himself in such as way as to lock himself into the North Face holdall bag, with a key to the padlock inside. Video provided to the court shows one of them, Peter Faulding, folding himself laboriously into an identical bag placed in a bathtub. Faulding, who specializes in rescuing people from confined spaces, told the inquest that he had tried to lock himself into the bag 300 times without success. A second expert witness, also of a size and build similar to Williams, tried 100 times to re-enact the feat without succeeding. Neither ruled out definitively the possibility that Williams could have somehow done it alone. But a small trace of someone else\\'s DNA was found on the bag, helping spawn all kinds of theories about who else might have been there. Williams was recruited into the intelligence services straight from university, working with Government Communications Headquarters before MI6. The nature of his work and questions around why his spy agency bosses took so long to raise an alert about his absence have added to the intrigue surrounding his death. Concerns about national security have been a factor in the 20-month delay in holding Williams\\' inquest, and an agency more used to working in the shadows has had an uncomfortably bright light shone into its practices. A series of photographs provided by the Metropolitan Police show the tidy, impersonal interior of the spy\\'s Pimlico home and the small white-tiled bathroom where his body was found. A bicycle parked in the hallway is a clue to Williams\\' passion for cycling. A glimpse through a bedroom door shows a bed half-made, clothes lying on it. But little else can be gleaned from the images. The Metropolitan Police says it is continuing its investigation, particularly in light of the coroner\\'s findings and the concerns raised by his family. But for now, the identity of the unknown person who apparently put the bag holding Williams into the bath, exactly how he died and the reason why, remain as much a mystery as ever.

But there's a new generation of supersonic passenger aircraft beginning to emerge, boasting speeds at least twice as fast as current commercial planes. While these planes will first appear in the private and business jet market, catering only to the super rich with gargantuan price tags and first class service, supersonic may eventually reach regular holidaymakers. Scroll down for video . Super-fast: The N+2 jet designed by Lockheed Martin aims to cut the time from New York to LA by half . One such jet, the N+2, designed by US global aerospace Lockheed Martin, is intended for commercial airlines, and aims to cut the travel time from New York to Los Angeles by half - from five hours to just 2.5. The aircraft would accommodate 80 passengers and have a tri-jet configuration in which one engine is on top of the aircraft and the other two are under each wing to reduce sonic boom. 'To achieve revolutionary reductions in supersonic transportation airport noise, a totally new kind of propulsion system is being developed,' said Michael Buonanno, Lockheed Martin manager of the NASA N+2 program. Supersonic: The Aerion AS2  jet will use proprietary supersonic laminar flow technology, \\xa0flying at 1,217mph . 'We are also exploring new techniques for low noise jet exhaust, integrated fan noise suppression, airframe noise suppression and computer customized airport noise abatement.' Meanwhile, in Reno, Airbus is teaming up with US-based Aerospace firm Aerion to create a supersonic jet that can fly from London to New York in three hours and from Los Angeles to Tokyo in six. The Aerion AS2 business jet will fly at 1,217mph, using\\xa0proprietary supersonic laminar flow technology -  almost as fast as Concorde, which flew at 1,350mph. Engineers from Airbus' Defence and Space Division will work with Aerion at its base in Nevada. The cost of the AS2 is thought to be more than $100million - over £60million - and Aerion hopes test flights will begin by 2019. The cost of the AS2 is thought to be more than $100m (£60m) - and test flights will begin by 2019 . The jet, which will fly between major global cities, will be made mostly from carbon fibre composite material. Design features include\\xa0wings which reduce overall drag by 20 per cent, allowing for lower fuel consumption and longer range and a luxurious 30-foot-long cabin will seat up to 12 passengers. Aerion chairman\\xa0Robert M Bass, said in a statement: 'This is a major step forward for Aerion. It puts us solidly on track toward our objective of certifying the world's first supersonic business jet in 2021.' After 27 years of service, British Airways retired the Airbus' Concorde airliner - which travelled at more than twice the speed of sound - \\xa0in October 2003, signalling the end of the supersonic passenger jet. Interior:\\xa0A 30-foot-long cabin will seat up to 12 passengers in business-style comfort . Aerospace company Lockheed Martin is behind the ambitious N+2 design. Plane aims to fly from New York to LA in 2.5 hours - half the current five-hour time. The aircraft would accommodate 80 passengers and have a tri-jet configuration. Designer aim to reduce noise caused by sonic boom. Airbus is teaming up with Aerospace firm Aerion to create a supersonic jet. The Aerion AS2 business jet will fly at 1,217mph - 133mph slower than Concorde. Test flights will begin in 2019 for the$100m (£60m) jet. Airbus' Defence and Space Division will work with Aerion at its base in Nevada. Modern commercial long-haul jets typically cruise at speeds between 480mph and 560mph . The plan is to certify the  plane in 2021 with first delivery in 2022. Flight testing would begin in roughly 2019. Aerion officials knew it would take a well-established original equipment manufacturer to complete the project, he said. 'We couldn't be more delighted with the choice of Airbus,' Barents said. 'We think that their footprint around the world is clearly going to help us as we develop the airplane.' Flight testing could begin on the supersonic jet as early as 2019 with it becoming available in 2021 . Billionaire Bass has been open about his personal mission to\\xa0offer the first business jet to fly faster than the speed of sound, a project begun in 2002. Aerion, Chief Executive Officer Doug Nichols, told CNN: 'The collaboration with Airbus was an essential piece in order to bring the expertise of a premier aircraft development concern into the fold.' The US forbids civilian planes from \\xa0the sound barrier - about 750mph per hour - while flying overland due to noisy sonic booms, but the AS2 model will fly at subsonic speeds until it reaches the ocean, when it will speed up. Over Europe it can fly at supersonic speeds without detection.\",\n",

'This island life is for me!' declares Pixie in an Instagram post (via her ghost writer, mother Roxy Jacenko.) Miss Curtis is pictured sipping poolside in Milan, Italy this week, enjoying much-deserved break from her busy life as a toddler-entrepreneur . Dolce & Gabbana - perfect for preschool! PR Queen Roxy Jacenko's two-year-old daughter Pixie shows that she's inherited her mother's taste! A photo was posted on Pixie's infamous Instagram account, showing the tot posing with some shopping from the high-fashion, uber expensive brand. Pixie, who turns three this month, was active on social media during a chic getaway to Milan, Italy this week. Followers at Pixie's Instagram profile, @pixiecurtis  were able to see the toddler enjoying the high-life. The little girl's posts revealed a lavish lifestyle, including first class travel, a private chopper ride and shopping designer brands. Instagram posts from the luxe vacation show Pixie shopping at Chanel and Dolce & Gabanna, lounging poolside and wearing an eye mask in a first class pod on her flight to Milan. It's the high-life - literally. Pixie Curtis (left) poses with her mother whilst on board a private helicopter during their sojourn in Milan this week. As you do. Diamonds are a girls best friend! A photo on Pixie's Instagram account shows her tiny fingers sporting some serious bling, as the toddler tries her mother, Roxy Jacenko's rings on for size. Pixie Curtis is sporting some serious wheels, only 13 years before she can apply for her Learner licence! The tot has a stylish lifestyle and impressive wardrobe, but little Pixie earns her keep. Pixie's account is a revenue stream for Roxy's Ministry Of Talent business, with brands charged $200 a post to plug their wares. Pixie also has her line of hair bows for children, Pixie's Bows, which her blog and Instagram account work to promote. Business-savvy Jacenko, the owner of PR agency Sweaty Betty, says she is using the income to create a trust fund for her daughter. Ms Jacenko, 33, reasons that Pixie will have her own empire by the time she grows up 'all on her own merit.' Decisions decisions! Pixie snaps a pic of her options before a photo shoot. Her ensembles are always accessorised with a bow form her own accessory line, Pixie's Bows. The perfect bedroom for the Princess of Instagram! Pixie shows off her very, very pink bed - the dream bed for an little girl. When in Milan! Pixie clutches a bottle on board a yacht in Italy during her European vacation with her parents this week. Pixie (well, her mother, Roxy Jacenko) posted this photo to Pixie's 28 thousand Instagram followers . 'Pixie has an account which I opened a week after she was born and anything that she earns goes into that account so when she's older, she has a good start,' the 34-year-old previously told the MailOnline. 'I'm going to teach her to be smart with her money, as my parents did with me, work hard, earn it but don’t blow it on materialistic things until you have property. 'It's like driving a Ferrari but renting where you live – I am of the breed you buy where you have to live and in turn be extravagant with token items.' Baby's first Chanel: Pixie Curtis does a spot of shopping at the chic Chanel store in Milan during her vacation last week. Living the high life! Miss Curtis poses in front of a private jet before 'skipping from the #cotedazur to #paris for a spot of shopping xxx' 'Commercial opportunities-wise, I am a business person, you don’t say never – you take each and every opportunity as it comes,' the 33-year-old added. 'I guess it’s the entrepreneur in me. If I can help the kids get a head start – fantastic!' In a move that Jacenko described as 'ludicrous', the popular Instagram account was temporarily removed in June this year. The mother-of-two was outraged when her daughter's account was deleted, with Instagram claiming it violated the photo-sharing app's age restrictions. Pixie Curtis makes around $200 for her sponsored posts on Instagram, where the sassy toddler and her PR expert mother, Ms Jacenko post photos to spruik products. She also uses the social media image-sharing site to promote her own accessory line, 'Pixie's Bows.' The photo above was shared on Instagram to offer her followers an exclusive discount for her hair bows. Here comes the Prince! Pixie Curtis' three-month-old baby brother, Hunter Curtis (pictured middle) has more than 3000 followers on his Instagram account, but is yet to post a photo - which is quite understandable... But after writing to Instagram headquarters explaining the account is not run by a two-year-old but in fact her social media savvy mother the account was re-activated. 'It's all a bit silly really, a harmless account run by a 33-year-old mother to share funny content – it's hardly breaking any laws,' Ms Jacenko said. Roxy and her troubled investment banker husband Oliver Curtis welcomed Hunter into the world in May. Hunter has more than three thousand followers on Instagram, but the three-month old is yet to post a photo. 'When the time is right I will start doing some posts of his journey with his sister ... to share the images with friends and family,' she explained. The children's finance professional father faces possible jail time over insider trading allegations. Earlier this year, Curtis entered a plea of not guilty at an arraignment hearing on charges he traded illegally to make a $1 million profit. He is currently on bail. Look out world! The adorable little girl poses in front of her family's Louis Vuitton luggage, sending a message of peace to the close to 30 thousand people that follow to see her daily posts.\",\n",

Kurt Busch appeared in court on Tuesday over Patricia Driscoll's request for a no-contact order. 'Everybody on the outside can tell me I'm crazy, but I lived on the inside and saw it firsthand,' Busch said when his attorney, Rusty Hardin, questioned why he still believed Driscoll is a hired killer. Kurt Busch has claimed his former girlfriend Patricia Driscoll is a trained killer . Driscoll has requested a no-contact order from the court against Busch . In an interview late Tuesday, Driscoll called Busch's assertion 'ludicrous,' saying he took it 'straight from a fictional movie script' she has been working on for eight years and that he has proofread. In court, Busch continued the push of his legal team to discredit his ex as a scorned woman out to destroy his career, portraying her as a character fit for a screenplay. Busch said Driscoll repeatedly asserted her assassin status and claimed the work took her on missions across Central and South America and Africa. He recounted one time when the couple was in El Paso, Texas. He said Driscoll left in camouflage gear only to return later wearing a trench coat over an evening gown covered with blood. A day earlier, Busch said his ex-girlfriend told him she was a mercenary who killed people for a living and had shown him pictures of bodies with gunshot wounds. Busch said on Tuesday that Driscoll had claimed that a female character in 'Zero Dark Thirty,' a film depicting the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden, was a composite of her and other women. Driscoll arrives at Kent County Family Court in America last December . Busch and Drisoll arrive for their protective order hearing last December . Last month, Michael Doncheff, who served as a personal assistant to Busch and Driscoll, said an ailing Driscoll told him in September that she had been picked up by a big man and slammed to the ground while helping round up immigrants at the Mexican border, a story Doncheff considered 'far-fetched.' Doncheff said Driscoll also asserted that she was a trained assassin for the U.S. government and once told him, 'I take down foreign governments. I own Washington.' During the hearing, which stretched over four days, neither Driscoll nor her attorney refuted the testimony. In a telephone interview with The Associated Press late Tuesday, Driscoll dismissed Busch's assertions. 'These statements made about being a trained assassin, hired killer, are ludicrous and without basis and are an attempt to destroy my credibility,' Driscoll said. 'Not even Rusty Hardin believes this.' 'I find it interesting that some of the outlandish claims come straight from a fictional movie script I've been working on for eight years,' Driscoll added. Busch testified Monday that he decided to end his relationship with Driscoll after a race last fall because she was monopolizing his schedule and he needed to focus on racing. Busch mingles with fans as he is introduced at a NASCAR Sprint Cup series event in November . Bush says he broke up with Driscoll to concentrate on his racing . Driscoll said Busch assaulted her in his motorhome at Dover International Speedway a week later, grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times. Busch and his attorneys have denied the allegations, which are the subject of a separate criminal investigation. Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice, cross-examined Busch on Tuesday, but few of her questions dealt directly with the assault allegations. Busch has testified that he repeatedly told Driscoll to leave after she showed up unannounced at his motorhome, finally cupping her cheeks in his hands, looking her in the eye and telling her she had to go. 'He advised that her head tapped the wall as he was doing that,' Detective James Wood testified Tuesday, recounting Busch's interview with Dover police in November. Richard Andrew Sniffen, a Christian music minister who performs at NASCAR outreach events and befriended Busch and Driscoll, said Driscoll told him on the night of the alleged assaul that Busch had pushed her and that she hit her head. Sniffen said Driscoll was upset, angry and brokenhearted, but that she never said she was afraid of Busch and seemed intent on reconciling. Busch poses with Monter Energy Girls before a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event in November . That attitude shifted in the weeks that followed, Sniffen said, with Driscoll going 'from a broken heart looking for love and reconciliation to anger and a little bit of revenge.' 'I will destroy him,' Sniffen said Driscoll told him, adding that she repeatedly said she would take Busch down. A court ruling on Driscoll's request for a no-contact order is expected later this month or in early February.\",\n",

Sitting in the public gallery at Bristol Crown Court, civil servant Ruth Edwards grasped her sister's hand and collapsed in tears as her father David was jailed for killing her mother. Yet, the 28-year-old, who works at the Ministry of Defence, was not just grieving for her 44-year-old mother Michaela, who had been strangled to death with her own dressing gown cord. She was mourning the fact that her father, who also worked at the MoD, would spend the next 11 years behind bars. In a remarkable act of forgiveness, Ruth and her younger sister Sara, 25, even sent a letter to the court begging for their dad's freedom. They described their parents as 'a couple who couldn't be apart but shouldn't have been together'. 'They had an intense and destructive relationship that brought out the worst in each other,' they added. Heartbreaking: David Edwards was jailed for strangling his wife Michaela to death. His daughters Ruth and Sara, are still close to their dad. Ruth, centre, is pictured with Sara, left, and their father, right, when they were younger . Now, speaking for the first time since that day four years ago, Ruth said: 'A lot of people will struggle to understand how we could forgive dad. 'But I've never blamed him for mum's death because it was not his fault. He's like two different people to me. The person who killed my Mum wasn't my dad. He was someone different, who wasn't in control of what he was doing. 'My dad is a really gentle man and it must have taken a lot to push him to do something so awful. He lost his rag and saw red. That's how I deal with it in my head. I separate the person who killed mum from the person who is my dad.' Ruth's story is told in the Cutting Edge documentary Lifers, which is screened on Channel 4 tonight. Filmmakers were granted unprecedented access to Leicester's Gartree Prison, home to 600 men sentenced to life in jail. David Edwards, now 51, who worked for the MoD in Bristol, has been at the prison since he was sentenced to life on November 12, 2008. He had strangled his wife at their home in Bradley Stoke, near Bristol after she had taunted him about her new lover. Edwards, who is now doing a degree in art history, told the programme: 'I feel I had all the advantages life had to offer me. That makes me feel my crime is in some way worse than everybody else's. When you kill the person you love, it's almost like a double grief. You grieve for the loss and you grieve for the fact you've caused that loss.' Tragic: David and Michaela on their wedding day. David strangled his wife at their home in Bradley Stoke, near Bristol after she had taunted him about her new lover . It had all seemed so different when they got married at the Catholic Church in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, in the summer of 1983. Ruth was born on Valentine's Day the following year and Sara came along two years later. But in 1996 - when Ruth was 12 and Sara ten - the couple, who both worked for the MoD, were forced to relocate to Bristol. 'We were definitely aware they had problems,' recalled Ruth. 'They had lots of fights over money and the stress it was causing. I think moving to Bristol made things worse because Mum was away from her family and lost her support network and missed her parents. 'But I have lots of good memories from childhood – going out for day trips to London Zoo and on family holidays. When they weren't fighting there was a lot of love between them and things were really good.' The couple's relationship teetered on until their daughters had left school but in 2005 they separated for a year. Edwards moved out to live in a flat in Bath while his wife stayed in the family home with Ruth. Sara was in her first year at Hull University. 'Mum and Dad weren't talking at the time,' said Ruth. 'I remember her finding a receipt for some furniture he was buying. He had rented a flat and had the delivery details on it with his new address. Mum read it and said: “Oh. He must be moving out.” Difficult: Ruth and Sara visiting a zoo with their mother Michaela. The sisters said their parents had 'an intense and destructive relationship that brought out the worst in each other' 'I was quite relieved at the time because I wanted them both to be happy – and if they weren't happy together I'd rather they were happy apart. The tension was so high – they would fight, not talk for a couple of months and then get back together and then the cycle would start again. 'But at the same time it's so hard when your parents split up. You feel awful and you are torn in two directions. You don't want to take sides. Dad was in a serious bout of depression and wouldn't talk to anyone while Mum saw it as a new start.' However, about a year later, Edwards returned home. 'He wrote to Mum saying he was ill and would like to meet up and talk about it,' said Ruth. 'She went for a drink with him and he came back with her and sat down in the front room. It was all a bit confusing. They didn't explain anything to us. They just went on as if nothing had changed. Sadly they didn't have marriage counselling.' Close: Ruth and Sara with their father on bonfire night. The two sisters sent a letter to Bristol Crown Court begging for their dad's freedom before he was sentenced for killing their mother . Within a year Ruth had moved out, exhausted by her parents on-off relationship. She barely spoke to her mother again. 'It became unbearable living there,' explained Ruth. 'That's why I moved out. We never had any big blow-ups but she would give me the cold shoulder and silent treatment and act like I wasn't there.' Ruth did not talk to her mother again until her father had a heart attack in March 2008. Even then her mum got a friend to call her. By then her parents were separated - although they lived in the same house, ate together, travelled to work together and went on trips together. Edwards still did the washing, his wife's ironing and paid the major bills. When he was in hospital, his wife visited him every day. 'I went out of my way to drive her to the hospital,' recalled Ruth. 'But she treated me like a taxi driver. She was so rude. She was very short and abrupt and couldn't bear to say thank you to me.' Happy: Ruth, Sara and their father are pictured on holiday in Bulgaria. David was sentenced to 11 years behind bars for killing their mother . But towards the end of the year, Michaela began dating someone else and Edwards emailed both his daughters asking to stay the night. 'It was the first time I had seen him since his heart attack,' said Ruth. 'He was very down. There was definitely something wrong. But he didn't specify what it was and I didn't push him. Perhaps I should have? Hindsight is a brilliant thing.' Ruth spent Christmas with her sister and the pair had lunch with Ruth's now ex-boyfriend Roy, a warehouse worker, on December 27. When they returned home, two policemen knocked at the door and told them their mother was in hospital. The detectives said that their father was in a police cell, having called 999 and confessed to strangling her. 'I remember thinking there must be a mistake,' she said. 'I couldn't believe Dad had done anything to her. I was in complete shock. I remember saying: “Are you sure it was him?” But they said: “Yes. He confessed straight away.”' The girls immediately went to visit their mother in Frenchay Hospital, where she was in intensive care.\\xa0 But four days later, on New Year's Eve, they decided to switch their mother's life support machine off. 'I had mixed feelings seeing her at the hospital,' said Ruth, who had not spoken to her mother for ten months.\\xa0 She looked very tiny and vulnerable. A wave of emotion hit me because it was so sad. But we knew she was not going to wake up from the coma.' Happier times: David and Michaela with Sara in London. The couple's daughters said they couldn't be apart but shouldn't have been together . The funeral was held at Westbury-on-Trym crematorium and the whole family attended apart from Edwards who was in custody. The next time the girls saw their father was in court when he pleaded guilty to their mother's murder. 'We had been hoping that he would not plead guilty,' revealed Ruth. 'But Dad didn't want a trial or to see Mum's name dragged through the mud. Even now he still cherishes her above all else. There's no doubt he's still in love with her.' Since their father was jailed, both Ruth and Sara have travelled a 250-mile round trip to visit him each month. 'It was such a lovely feeling to be able to see him after everything we had all gone through,' explained Ruth. We just wanted to say to him: “It's OK. We're not angry with you. We understand.” Although he was in total shock – his eyes were barely focusing – you could see that he felt relieved. 'What is surprising is that my sister and I have discovered that we are both a lot stronger than we thought we would be. 'Neither Sara nor I have had counselling. We talked about it a bit but felt we didn't need it. To some people it might seem strange. But the bond between Dad, Sara and me is stronger than ever.'

Not offended: Pontiff said he does not agree with Marxist ideology but has met \\'good people\\' who do . Pope Francis said in a newspaper interview yesterday that he is not a Marxist but that even they can be good people. Responding to conservative criticisms that his economic and social ideas smack of communism Francis also denied reports that he would name a woman cardinal. Last month, American radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who has a huge following in the United States, railed against the pope for written comments made on the world economy. Limbaugh, who is not Catholic, said that parts of the document were \\'pure Marxism coming out of the mouth of the pope\\' and suggested that someone else had written the papal document for him. He also accused the pope of going \\'beyond Catholicism\\' and being \\'purely political\\'. Asked about the accusations, which sparked a debate in the media last month, Francis, a member of the all-male Jesuit order associated with progressive social policies, told La Stampa: \\'Marxist ideology is wrong. But in my life I have known many Marxists who are good people, so I don’t feel offended.\\' In last month’s document, seen as a platform for his papacy, Francis attacked unfettered capitalism as \\'a new tyranny\\' said an \\'economy of exclusion and inequality\\' had proven to be deadly for many people around the world. In his response to the critics, Francis said he was not speaking \\'as a technician but according to the social doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, and this does not mean being Marxist\\'. He said he was just trying to present a \\'snapshot of what is happening\\' in the world today. On Wednesday, Pope Francis was named 2013 Person . of the Year by Time magazine - edging out NSA whistleblower and . fugitive Edward Snowden into second place . Asked about speculation that a woman could be among the new cardinals he will appoint early next year, he said: \\'I don’t know where that idea comes from. Women in the Church should be valued, not \"clericalised\".\\' In another document last week, Francis said huge salaries and bonuses were symptoms of an economy based on greed and called again for nations to narrow the wealth gap.

William Thomas, 69, was told he had a harmless cyst on his arm when, actually, he had aggressive skin cancer . Doctors have been berated for wrongly diagnosing a patient’s cancerous tumour as a large, harmless cyst. William Thomas, 69, went to see his GP, Dr Juliana Hood, in Borth, Ceredigion, mid-Wales, in June 2012 with a lump on his arm - the same arm on which he’d had a cancer scare in 1995. He returned to the surgery nine weeks later and Dr Ian Hosker could find no record of his previous visit. Rather than make an urgent referral, the doctor diagnosed him with a ganglion - a . harmless lump filled with fluid - and gave him a standard referral to attend . the local hospital four weeks later. However, Mr Thomas knocked the lump, . which had grown to the size of an egg, while at work. When it didn't stop bleeding, he went to A&E, where he was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer. Mr Thomas, a builder, said: 'The . doctors at A&E said it was urgent and sent me to Gobowen hospital . the next day for a biopsy. After examining it, they had to do an . emergency operation to remove it.' The . lump was Merkel cell carcinoma, a very rare and aggressive form . of skin cancer. Its removal has left Mr Thomas barely able to work due . to loss of power and function in his right arm. His daughter, Mandy Daniel, said: 'The look on my dad’s face when they said it was a cancerous . tumour will never leave me - he was petrified. It’s been a horrific time . for the family.' After the family complained, the Public Service Ombudsman for Wales ruled that the doctors treating Mr Thomas were guilty of serious failings. Mr Thomas was awarded £750 compensation for the errors that led to a delay in his skin cancer diagnosis last year. Mr Thomas was awarded £750 compensation for the errors that led to a delay in his skin cancer diagnosis last year. His daughter, Mandy, was also given compensation for the way her complaint was handled . His daughter was given £200 for the way her initial complaint was handled. Ombudsman . Carys Williams found the first consultation was not recorded, that Mr . Thomas should have been seen by the practice’s minor surgery clinic . sooner given his previous cancer scare, and that opportunities were lost . to diagnose him sooner. The lump was Merkel cell carcinoma, a very rare and aggressive form of skin cancer . 'The failure here was in not referring Mr Thomas sooner, albeit I find that ultimately this only made two weeks difference,' she said. 'However, there were some fundamental and serious failures in record keeping.' Drs Hood and Hosker were told to apologise for their failings. In her report to the Ombudsman, Dr Hood said she had already closed the computer record on Mr Thomas when his arm was discussed and that she forgot to enter the details afterwards. She said she was 'horrified' to learn of his diagnosis and was unable to sleep or eat for some time after, eventually leaving the practice. Dr Hood has personally written to Mr Thomas’ daughter, apologising. Dr Hosker said he was convinced the lump was a ganglion, which was why he had not made an urgent referral. He said: 'This has been a distressing time for Mr Thomas and his family and I can apologise for this.' Jacqui Jones Brown, practice manager of Borth Surgery, declined to comment.\",\n",

              "  {'content': \"Looking shyly into the camera, nothing in Deng Wen Ge’s high school volleyball team photograph suggests that she was destined for bigger things. In this exclusive photograph from 1980, she was certainly taller than many of her classmates at 5ft 11 inches, but both her name – Chinese for ‘Cultural Revolution’ – and her conservative hairstyle fitted right in with her Communist peers in the factory city of Xuzhou. Few among her wealthy, well-connected society friends in the United States would recognize the teenage athlete, as Wendi Deng, who until last summer was the wife of Rupert Murdoch, the world’s most powerful and controversial media mogul. Young dreams: Wendi Deng, then known as Deng Wen Ge, in her high school volleyball team in 1980 . Work: Ms Deng was said to have had 'some cosmetic surgery work' when she moved to America with the main ambition of becoming 'rich and famous' Through sheer force of will and the patronage of certain well-placed friends, Wendi, the name she adopted in her teens, went from the poor daughter of a $50-a-month factory manager living in a town where the lights went out every night at 7pm to a multi-millionaire divorcee in a $60million triplex on Fifth Avenue in the city that never sleeps. The first step in her remarkable journey began with her arrival in California in February 1988 after meeting a 50-year-old American engineer working on a project in Xuzhou, who agreed to help improve her English. With the enthusiastic co-operation of his wife, Jake Cherry sponsored Wendi’s student visa and put her up at their La Cresenta, California, home sharing a bedroom with their five-year-old daughter. Suddenly, from sharing clothes with friends in Xuzhou and donning her lookalike high school volleyball team uniform, Wendi was wearing pairs of $200 jeans, her California State University, Northridge, economics professor Daniel Blake told Vanity Fair. In a 2007 interview by writer Eric Ellis for Australia’s ‘The Monthly’ magazine, Blake also described Wendi as 'a trendy dresser, a modern girl'. Now: Ms Deng attended the New York Collection by Martin Katz reception at The New York Palace on February 11. It was the first time she was seen in public since a revealing Vanity Fair profile . According to another of her professors, Kenneth Chapman, Wendi, one of his brightest students, had ‘some kind of cosmetic surgery’ and turned up wearing dark glasses at around that time when she was living in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s. ‘I don’t remember a whole lot,’ Chapman said this week. ‘We are going back to the 1990s. ‘When she graduated there was a picture of her taken when she had a lunch with a couple of friends.’ ‘Can you imagine what it would've been like, how she got there with no knowledge of the culture?’ a New York friend of Wendi’s told Ellis. ‘It was almost inevitable that she was going to make some mistakes. I don't think she has an evil personality; she just has this incredible ambition coupled with this lack of self-consciousness. She got to California and she wanted to social-climb, to get out of the situation that got her there.’ By this time, the Cherry’s marriage had become a casualty of Wendi’s move to the West. According to a numerous reports, Jake Cherry - who is now 76 - was kicked out of the family home by his wife, Joyce, after she discovered he was having an affair with his young protégé. Power: Ms Deng enjoyed a rapid rise from the daughter of a factory worker in Communist China to the wife of Rupert Murdoch, enjoying a life of luxury in a $60million triplex on Fifth Avenue, New York . Wendi and Cherry wed in February 1990, but the marriage lasted just four months before she met a . Revelations: The Vanity Fair piece stoked up rumors that she had a crush on former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and liked his 'good body' younger man, David Wolf, who was closer to her own age. The Wall Street Journal later reported the divorce became official after two years and seven months in 1992, which is seven months longer than what was required for Deng to obtain a 'green card'. From there, Deng’s social ascent became all the more rapid. She enrolled in an MBA course at the prestigious Yale School of management in 1995 and as part of her internship requirement she won a temporary job at Star TV, a satellite television station in Hong Kong that was owned by Murdoch’s NewsCorp. The internship may have taken her back to Communist China, but it was also the direct route to the heart of one of the titans of capitalism. Simply put, according to her old Star TV colleagues, Deng’s ‘ambition was to be rich and famous.’ It wasn’t long before an opportunity came her way to meet Murdoch when she was reportedly asked to accompany him as an interpreter and guide on a trip to Shanghai. The May-December working relationship developed into a romance, rocking the Murdoch family. Murdoch and Wendi were married in 1999, just 17 days after his divorce from ex-wife Anna. The union would bring the couple two children and all the fame Wendi could have ever dreamed of. She met the Queen of England and hobnobbed with tycoons and movie stars. Her photograph was a staple of the society columns and, if a recent Vanity Fair article is to believed, she was impressed by other powerful men like Google chairman Eric Schmidt. According to a note to herself written by Wendi that was published in Vanity Fair, she was more than happy with the way her transformation from Chinese factory town girl to Manhattan society maven has worked out. Break up: Ms Deng divorced Mr Murdoch last year after having two of his children. Her notes that were revealed in Vanity Fair revealed that she thought she had 'style, grace' that she 'looked gorgeous and so young, so cool' ‘Lisa [girlfriend of Eric Schmidt, left] will never have my style, grace,’ she wrote. ‘I achieved my purpose of Eric saw me looking so gorgeous and so fantastic and so young, so cool, so chic, so stylish, so funny and he cannot have me.’ The article also revealed details of a lovestruck note from Ms Deng, in which she praised former British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s ‘good body’, his ‘really, really good legs’ and even his ‘butt’. It said staff at Mr Murdoch’s home in Carmel, California, were uneasy when Mr Blair arrived and tried to find her. The magazine claimed they told him Ms Deng had gone to the master bedroom, but ‘by the time they could tell her, Mr Blair was looking for her, they found Mr Blair walking into the master bedroom and closing the door behind him’. On another occasion ‘they were feeding each other during dinner, which made the staff uncomfortable’, the magazine claimed. Mr Blair’s friends deny he had an affair, they were feeding each other and that he was ever alone with Ms Deng. Vanity Fair says Mr Blair had 'rolled his eyes' and looked 'panicked' when he was told Mr Murdoch would not be joining them until the following night. Just a week after the Vanity Fair story broke, Wendi, now 45, was back in the limelight hosting a diamond promotional night in New York. Wearing a glamorous lace black and cerise gown she could afford to smile for the camera. She’d come a very long way from that posed team photo with her high school sports team.\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'Norway\\'s police are facing tough questions over their response to last Friday\\'s terror attacks, in which 76 people died. First, Oslo was rocked by a huge blast outside government buildings, which left eight people dead. Less than two hours later, a gunman reached Utoya island, some 20 miles away, and proceeded to fire on the mostly teenage participants of a political summer camp for well over an hour. Reporters, particularly from the foreign press, have asked why it took an hour from the police first being alerted for armed officers to arrest the suspect, 32-year-old Anders Behring Breivik. Among their questions have been why a helicopter was not used to take elite officers to the scene, rather than them travelling by road, and whether problems with a police boat -- which meant civilian vessels had to be commandeered -- delayed the response. Some have also asked whether the response to the bombing in the Norwegian capital took priority over the Utoya alert, with emergency phone operators and resources already tied up as frantic calls started to come in from young people under fire on the island. Sissel Hammer, chief of police for the Nordre Buskerud district, which covers Utoya, told reporters Wednesday that her officers and members of an elite police unit had done their best to get to the island quickly. \"I don\\'t think we had any chance to be there faster than we made it,\" she said. Responding to the situation in Utoya was \"the highest priority\" for local police, and was not affected by events in Oslo, she said. Her staff had done a \"very demanding job\" both during and after the event, she added. At the same press conference, Haavard Gaasbakk, who was a commander on the scene, described how he grabbed his equipment and raced to the embarkation point for Utoya when the alarm was raised. A problem with the engine of the police boat meant the 10 or so emergency personnel who had met there had to take two privately owned motor boats instead, he said. However, these made the 700-meter crossing of the deep Tyrifjorden lake faster than the police boat would have done, he said. As they approached, the police heard \"a lot of shooting\" from the southern part of the wooded island, with gunshots \"coming fast and thick,\" Gaasbakk said. Officers ran toward the shooting and were about 350 meters away, in very difficult terrain, when they started to shout to the suspect, he said. Suddenly they saw him in front of them with his hands above his head and his weapons -- a rifle and an automatic pistol -- on the ground. The gunman was arrested by one officer as the others sought to find out of whether he was working alone and started to give first aid to a \"conveyor belt\" of the injured, Gaasbakk said. He spoke of his pride in the way police and local citizens rallied to help the injured. Hammer said an evaluation of the police response would be carried out later this year. A day earlier, police spokesman Johan Fredriksen rejected criticism of the police response to the massacre in Utoya. \"I don\\'t think this could have gone faster,\" he said. \"I don\\'t see how that would be possible with the distance and with these conditions. We always try to be better but I don\\'t see how we could have done this faster.\" He said the police had only one helicopter, which is kept at Gardemoen airfield north of Oslo, and that it would not have been suitable to transport a team of counter-terror officers from the capital to the scene. \"It took time to get the staff in. It was filled with irrelevant equipment for the purpose and has never been used for such operations,\" he said of the helicopter. \"I am of the opinion it would not have been any quicker to use it.\" The former police inspector for Oslo, Finn Abrahamsen, told Norwegian reporters he felt it was a pity the helicopter was on the ground on the day of the attack. Anstein Gjengedal, of Oslo police district -- which pays for the national police helicopter service from its budget -- acknowledged it was flying less hours than it used to because of budget constraints. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg announced an independent commission of inquiry Wednesday, which he said would take an exhaustive look at what had happened and report back within a year on what lessons could be learned. But he rejected the suggestion that his country was naive and unready for potential attacks, saying Norway\\'s security forces were aware of the danger of violent attacks and were prepared for them.

The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood watch for sections of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas.   Severe thunderstorms are forecast across much of the same area. By Wednesday morning, accumulations up to 10 inches of rain are expected in northeast Texas and southeast Oklahoma, up to 8 inches in southwest Arkansas, with 4 to 5 inches being common across the rest of the watch area, forecasters said. Severe weather raked the heart of Texas Monday evening, with a suspected tornado touching down near Natalia, a town of about 1,400 residents. The Medina County, Texas, Sheriff\\'s Office said it received more than 300 calls about damages or injuries. Charlie\\'s Ice House, a bar in Devine, was in shambles after winds barreled through, ripping off its roof. \"It happened so fast and everyone was getting away from the doors ... and then it was over,\" said co-owner Marilyn Banks, adding that none of the 20 to 25 people inside suffered much more than a few scratches. Authorities, though, are \"in rescue mode\" searching for a motorcycle rider who is unaccounted for since the system came through, said Lawrence Trevino, San Antonio\\'s emergency manager who is assisting neighboring counties in the response. He said that some injuries have been reported, but there are no known deaths after the strong winds damaged about six homes. Joanne Ortiz said she saw what appeared to be three funnel clouds from her home in Devine. \"At first we were fascinated by it. But once we saw two of them, we thought, where do we go?\" said Ortiz, who lives in a one-story manufactured home on a 3-acre lot. In Bexar County, which includes San Antonio, Fire Marshall\\'s Office spokeswoman Laura Jesse said there \"are reports of damage to one home in southwest Bexar County\" but otherwise the impact appears to be limited. \"This is a rural area, so it\\'s not that populated,\" Jesse said. In Hurst, located in the Dallas-Forth Worth area, high winds ripped the awning off a strip mall, CNN affiliate KTVT-TV reported. The unsettled weather pattern brought snow to the western United States over the weekend and more was forecast for Tuesday. The city of Flagstaff was still digging out of 10 to 14 inches of snow, which prompted school closings in the city. The city of Prescott received 8 to 12 inches. iReport: Are you there? Send us your weather photos . Brandon Neuman of Flagstaff produced a time-lapse video of about a foot of snow falling on his backyard deck in seven hours. \"The other day it was 65 degrees, next day it is snowing, so it\\'s been crazy,\" Neuman said. \"It killed a lot of people\\'s travel plans because the highways are a mess.\" But in eastern parts of the country, balmy conditions prevailed, with temperatures well above average from Texas and the Midwest all the way to the East Coast.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'intended or not -- illustrative of the tough Republican-driven voter identification law that critics contend intimidates and disenfranchises minority voters. Moreover, this is all playing out amid hardening partisan divisions nationwide and legal and legislative battles as the nation hurtles toward a midterm vote with the Senate at stake and a presidential ballot in 2016. A man with a mission . At the VIP headquarters in a commercial office park in Raleigh that resembled many low-budget start-ups, complete with a dry-ink erase board, folding tables with chairs and a big wood, scuffed desk, DeLancy proudly walked through the inter workings of his organization that includes a few dozen volunteers spread around the state. Bald and 56, he seems at least a decade younger than his age. His enthusiasm screams through his rabidly opinionated professions about how voting should work. He thinks the mentally ill should be barred from voting, felons should be restored their voting right after they serve their sentence and probation, homeless people should be allowed to vote but only if they remain at the address they put on their voter registration form, and those who don\\'t know the issues should stay home. DeLancy co-opted his tactics from True the Vote, a well-funded yet controversial conservative group in Texas that prioritizes citizen enforcement of the voter laws. Framed by a 12-foot long map of North Carolina divided into counties and congressional districts on loan from a Republican member of the state legislature, DeLancy also talks about the need for a strict photo ID law and that fraudulent voting is rampant in elections. And he\\'s doing everything he can to ensure that his vision of the election system is carried out. To address their concerns, DeLancy and his volunteers plow through public data -- tax records, voting records, jury records, census data and death records - scouring for suspicion and inconsistencies. He compares tax data with DMV records, voting records in North Carolina with voting records in Florida, jury data with voter rolls. He calls it data mining. All this information is then inserted into an algorithm, creating spreadsheets upon spreadsheets for volunteers to investigate. When red flags are raised, they might turn it over to the Board of Elections or they might check it out themselves. Looking in a liberal bastion . In Buncombe County, which includes the western city of Asheville, a liberal bastion in a relatively conservative state, DeLancy\\'s forces teamed with a local tea party group to analyze data. When five or more registered voters are listed at one address, a red flag goes up. Then they put on their shoes and pound the pavement. \"We would actually knock on the door at that address,\" DeLancy said. His volunteers would check to see who lived there and if it matched the records. The response? \"Some would slam the door in our face,\" DeLancy said, but added that others would answer their questions. If doubts persisted after confronting residences, they\\'d move to Stage Two. VIP would address a letter to the person in question. If the letter came back with \"return to sender,\" that letter became evidence to submit to the Board of Elections. DeLancy said a worst-case scenario would involve someone voting fraudulently or, at the very least, they need to be removed from the voter rolls for not living at the address listed. DeLancy took 180 cases to the Buncombe County elections board and a little more than half the names were stricken from the voter rolls. Jane Bilello, a volunteer with the Voter Integrity Project and head of the Asheville Tea Party who participated in the door-to-door checks, said the reason they are checking the voter rolls name by name is simple: \"We\\'re doing it because the (political) parties aren\\'t.\" Tea party group in North Carolina might give up on national races . Vigilante or vindicator? DeLancy and his group are an aggravating nuisance whose tactics do more damage than good, according to fellow good governance groups with opposing ideological views. Sarah Zambon, president of Asheville League of Women Voters, said VIP targets minority and Democratic leaning districts, leading to voter disenfranchisement and voter intimidation. She said that of the 80 precincts in Buncombe County, all of VIP\\'s challenges came from 11 precincts, most of them low income or minority -- communities that are more likely to have more people living under one roof. \"It has an intimidation effect,\" Zambon said, detailing the story of one African American woman who said she didn\\'t feel comfortable when people showed up at her door and wanted to know where her sons lived. 2014 midterms: What\\'s at stake . Zambon also said he has effectively removed homeless people from the voter rolls for not being at a fixed address. DeLancy shot back, saying Zambon needs to \"cut the emotion and deal with the facts.\" \"Our laws are so lenient in favor of the voter that any person can claim they\\'re homeless and vote from anywhere,\" DeLancy said. North Carolina\\'s tamp down . North Carolina\\'s election record is good. The Pew Charitable Trusts\\' election initiative named it one of the top-performing states in 2012. The organization cited increased voter registration, few problems with provisional ballots and minimal wait times at polls. Of the 88% of eligible voters are registered to vote, more than 65% voted in 2012, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts\\' Elections Performance Index and confirmed by the state. That turnout is similar to 2008 and both elections saw African Americans vote at a higher rate than whites, according to Democracy North Carolina, an election watchdog group. In addition, cases of fraud are negligible. The state\\'s Board of Elections says fraud is possible but the state doesn\\'t keep track. Elections board spokesman Josh Lawson said in the most recent statewide elections on May 6, one case of fraud was referred to the the local district attorney\\'s office and he anticipates \"at least three other\" cases will be investigated by the board of elections. But still, the state enacted one of the most stringent voter ID laws in the country, requiring one of a limited number of forms of identification at the poll starting in 2016. The law also gives voter vigilantes more power, enabling citizens to challenge another person\\'s vote anywhere in the state. Like laws of its kind that have been passed and challenged elsewhere, including in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin where the courts struck down the laws, North Carolina\\'s law is being challenged for disenfranchising voters. Michael Cobb, political science professor at North Carolina State University, said the law discourages people to vote, adding that the state that voted for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 has taken a step backward. 5 takeaways from North Carolina\\'s primary election . \"They\\'ve gone the wrong direction in the importance of protecting the vote,\" Cobb said. \"They\\'ve erred on the side of making sure no ineligible person would vote.\" While DeLancy aggressively advocated for the law, he pushed for a version that went even further. And thinks the state isn\\'t doing enough to enforce the laws and that high voter participation is an indicator that fraud is rampant. Mixed results . After three years of work and countless volunteer hours, DeLancy has no cases of fraud to show. He cites, however, that the board of elections has made five \"referrals\" of prosecution to local district attorneys. He blames the Republican-led board of elections and the inherent difficulty in the system to confirm fraud in the election system. \"We thought with two Republicans in charge they would work with us,\" DeLancy said. \"Even when we do the right thing, the authorities don\\'t really care.\" His group also challenged 130 people who are on the voter rolls who got out of jury duty for saying they weren\\'t a citizen. But the board of elections rejected their challenge. Despite falling short on the fraud front, the group has had some impact, including pushing the state to conduct more thorough list maintenance. He has played a role in removing about 30,000 people from the voter rolls, most of whom had died, which was confirmed by a state-led audit. That\\'s in addition to an ongoing state issued review of another 155,000 people who are also registered in other states. And to the chagrin of some and the delight of others, they\\'ve helped to raise the issue to a whole new level in the state. \"They\\'ve caused bureaucratic wheels to turn,\" Cobb said. Lawson said they welcome the work DeLancy - and all good governance groups - are doing. The state is looking into some of VIP\\'s findings, including 149 instancevs of people with the same name and birthday who voted in North Carolina and in Florida. But Bob Hall, executive director of Democracy North Carolina, a voter protection organization, said DeLancy\\'s group does \"sloppy\" research and submits piles of claims to the board of elections to sift through with no substantial outcome. \"They have the appearance of being a research group but they operate like a witch hunt group,\" Hall said. \"That\\'s not useful.\" DeLancy dismisses his critics and states the overall goal. \"We want to figure out how people are voting multiple times. That\\'s the whole ball game,\" he said. Complete coverage: 2014 midterms .',\n",

              "  {'content': \"In North Carolina, the Voter Integrity Project (VIP), led by Eric DeLancy, is actively working to identify and challenge voter fraud, a move that critics argue is more about voter intimidation than ensuring election integrity. DeLancy, a 56-year-old with a small team of volunteers, uses public data to scrutinize voter rolls, comparing tax, voting, and census records to find inconsistencies. His methods include door-to-door checks and sending letters to addresses to verify residency. In Buncombe County, a liberal area, VIP's efforts led to the removal of over half of the 180 challenged names from the voter rolls. However, groups like the League of Women Voters and Democracy North Carolina argue that VIP's tactics disproportionately target minority and low-income communities, leading to voter disenfranchisement and intimidation. Despite North Carolina's strong election performance and low fraud rates, the state has enacted one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country, which is currently being challenged in court. DeLancy's group has had mixed results, with no confirmed cases of fraud but some impact on voter roll maintenance.

              "  {'content': \"By . Claudia Joseph . and Sarah Oliver . Call-girl: Baronet's daughter Charlotte Colquhoun, pictured, is locked in a furious fight with the stables of multi-millionaire City boss Robin Geffen . Even for a man who plays the stock market for a living, giving a racehorse to a high-class call-girl was always going to be a bit of a risk. And now the stables of multi-millionaire investment fund manager Robin Geffen are locked in a furious fight with aristocratic escort Charlotte Colquhoun over the fate of the once much-fancied King of Wands. The horse, which belongs to Mr Geffen, was given to brunette Charlotte, 37, on the understanding that she would hack out on him and show him off in the ring. She was also supplied with a full set of leather tack. Mr Geffen made a payment of £2,000 in February to Charlotte for King of Wands’ upkeep. But to the dismay of the City titan, whose Neptune Fund Management is valued at £85\\u2009million by The Sunday Times, the £140-an-hour prostitute has put the injury-prone King of Wands up for sale behind his back. The gelding has been entered into an equine auction at Ascot on Tuesday. She has put him up for sale as a wildcard (or late) entry. He is listed in the Brightwells Ascot Sales Catalogue at Lot 48. Now Mr Geffen’s racing manager Charlie Liverton is begging Charlotte to give the horse back. Last week Mr Liverton emailed Charlotte – who is a gifted rider – saying: ‘I am very sorry to see that the King of Wands has been given a wildcard entry into the Brightwells Sales at Ascot next week and wondered if there was anything we could do to help? ‘As you know, he was given to you so that you could show him in the ring and enjoy him on hacks, and we duly sent a full set of tack, including saddle, with him on the understanding that this was where his future lay. We are therefore slightly perturbed to see him in the Ascot sale. Injury-prone: The £140-an-hour  prostitue has put the once much-fancied King of Wands, pictured, up for sale . ‘Would you be able to advise as to why you are now having to sell him? Could we look at taking him back off your hands and find him another suitable home? 'Our worry, of course, is his injury and the fact that he might well end up back in a racing yard, which would only cause him harm. We would like to prevent that if it were at all possible please.’ But Charlotte – the illegitimate eldest daughter of old Etonian baronet Sir Malcolm Colquhoun – is adamant King of Wands is hers to sell. ‘I am selling King of Wands because of a change of circumstances,’ she told The Mail on Sunday from her home in a Herefordshire village. ‘I’m having a clean-out of stock and am getting some new horses in.’ Successful: Investment fund manager Mr Geffen (left), 56, is pictured with other owners at the races . Mr Geffen denied knowing Miss Colquhoun, claiming she was a ‘fantasist’. He later confirmed he made a payment of £2,000 to her for the upkeep of the horse. King of Wands broke down in May 2012, and was sent to the Heart of Wales livery stable on February 7 this year. ‘He went with a new set of tack and on February 8, I paid £2,000 to cover two years cost of stabling him. This is usual practice when placing retired, broken-down racehorses,’ Mr Geffen said last night. Charlotte, who works as an escort under the pseudonym Charlie Foxtrot, is believed to have stabled the horse at the Welsh yard. The mother of two was exposed this year as a prostitute who encouraged wealthy clients to enjoy her services by trading on her aristocratic lineage. Her estranged father is a clan chieftain with 45,000 acres of land along the banks of Loch Lomond. Wealthy: Ms Colquhoun's father owns 45,000 acres of land, including the Loch Lomond estate, pictured . Charlotte, who was born to a girlfriend of the baronet before he was married, even posted a copy of the Colquhoun family crest alongside intimate pictures of herself on her Facebook page. She took to prostitution to bankroll a luxury lifestyle and was unashamed to have been unmasked in the media earlier this year, saying her work as an escort enabled her to keep two retired racehorses, four spaniels and to spend her time enjoying country pursuits. Mr Geffen, 56, who lives with his wife Camilla, 53, and two sons in a £2.5\\u2009million house near London’s exclusive Hurlingham Club, likes to maintain a low profile despite his substantial fortune. He set up the Neptune Investment Management Fund in 2001 from an office in Hammersmith, West London, and it has expanded to employ 112 people and manage £6.25\\u2009billion worth of assets. He sees horse racing as a relaxing hobby. ‘I have a high-pressure job and for the first five years after setting up Neptune, I had very little time. For me, though, a day’s racing is like a week’s holiday,’ he said. ‘I’m a pretty modest operator, I don’t lead a wild life and I work bloody hard. But going racing is a collective thing – we all get our pleasures from it in our different ways.’ Mr Geffen bought King of Wands, his first horse, in 2010 for an estimated £250,000 from breeder Philippa Cooper. The seven-year-old gelding – a son of Derby winner Galileo – has won £67,744 in prizemoney but has failed to fulfil its potential after straining a tendon. He is expected to fetch up to £10,000 at auction. Mrs Cooper is also distraught the horse is being sold, fearing his injury might see him sold for slaughter. She said: ‘You would not know to look at him that he has had a serious injury. If you put a horse in the Ascot sale, it’s like the last-chance saloon. You have the meat men there.’\",\n",

Geffen, whose Neptune Fund Management is valued at £85 million, gave the horse to Colquhoun in February, along with a full set of tack, for her to ride and show. He also paid £2,000 for the horse's upkeep. However, Colquhoun has now put King of Wands up for sale at an equine auction at Ascot, much to Geffen's dismay. Geffen's racing manager, Charlie Liverton, has reached out to Colquhoun, expressing concern about the horse's injury and the risk of it being sold for slaughter. Colquhoun, who works as an escort under the pseudonym Charlie Foxtrot, maintains that she is selling the horse due to a change in circumstances and plans to replace him with new horses.

According to a shock report, more than eight million adults in England are considered to lack even basic numeracy. The figures in the Skills For Life survey reveal that this quarter of the population has difficulty in understanding price labels and the sums involved in paying household bills. One in four adults has the maths skills of a nine-year-old or worse and struggles with the most basic sums . Their abilities are on a par with those expected of pupils at primary school aged between seven to nine. In an even more disturbing development, the number of adults in this group is nearly a million more than it was a decade ago. This is despite a stream of costly initiatives in recent years designed to improve adult numeracy. A further nine million adults have the maths skills expected of a child aged nine to 11. Those in this group are likely to struggle in calculating change, using train timetables or working out deductions on their pay slip. The Skills For Life survey revealed that altogether 49 per cent of working-age adults in England – about 17million in total – have the maths skills of a child at primary school. Numbers had risen from 15million in 2003, when a similar survey was conducted. The report also revealed that fewer than one in five 16 to 18-year-olds can demonstrate skills equivalent to a grade A* to C pass in maths at GCSE. This is despite the A* to C pass rate for the GCSE exam now being 60 per cent. Chris Humphries, chairman of the charity National Numeracy, said: ‘This discrepancy is both puzzling and worrying for everyone involved in education and merits further investigation. ‘Too many adults are struggling with everyday maths.’ The survey, which questioned 7,200 people aged 16 to 65, also revealed that more than five million adults – 15 per cent of the working population – struggle with simple reading and writing. The Department for Business, which released the 400-page report, admitted that English and maths skills had ‘a long way to go’. Ministers said improving basic skills was vital to a ‘thriving economy’. Skills minister Matthew Hancock said maths and English are vital for getting a job and playing a 'full part in society' Labour launched a major campaign in 2000 to boost the basic skills of adults but it is said to have mainly benefited literacy, where performance has improved since 2003. Ministers said that tough new English Baccalaureate Certificates to replace GCSEs from 2017 in core subjects would help to boost standards in both English and maths. From September of next year, new study programmes will require pupils to keep working towards GCSEs in maths and English if they failed to achieve them by the age of 16. Free maths and English GCSE courses are now available for adults, and other qualifications for those with lower skills levels. The survey, which questioned adults for whom English is their first language, found that literacy skills were worst in London and the North-East. Numeracy skills were worst in the North-East, followed by London and the East Midlands. Skills minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘Good English and maths are vital for getting a job and playing a full part in society. ‘We have doubled the funding for adult English and maths because they are so important. ‘I would urge anyone who is struggling to take advantage of the provision that is on offer, which now includes maths and English GCSEs for adults who missed out the first time round. ‘These essential skills are the building blocks of a productive society and a thriving economy. I am determined that everyone should have the chance to achieve their very best.’\",\n",

The agency said it has been in contact with Pennsylvania authorities. \"We will follow up on any credible lead that is provided to us,\" the statement said. Claims invite skepticism . Barbour told the newspaper that she began killing when she was 13. She took credit for more than 22 but fewer than 100 killings, Daily Item reporter Francis Scarcella told CNN affiliate WNEP. Authorities haven\\'t verified her claims, although they are investigating. Many are skeptical. Barbour and her husband, Elytte Barbour, 22, do face murder charges in the 2013 death of 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara, who police say the couple lured with a Craigslist ad, strangled, repeatedly stabbed and dumped in a yard.

Randy Steven Kraft may have killed as many as 65 young men in the 1970s and early 1980s. Based on the numbers she gave Scarcella, Barbour would have had to kill on average somewhere between every three weeks and every three months. For six years. Without leaving a trace. Yet in the 2013 killing, police documents show Barbour told police she and her husband couldn\\'t clean up all the blood LaFerrara\\'s killing left in her CR-V, and that one of the ways investigators traced the killing to her was her own cell phone. The last number dialed on LaFerrara\\'s phone led to Barbour, according to police. Even the prosecutor who hopes to convict the couple, Northumberland County District Attorney Tony Rosini, said he discounts Barbour\\'s other claims. \"As of this date, there has been no verification of any of the information that has been subject of media coverage regarding prior acts of the defendant, Miranda Barbour,\" Rosini said in a statement. \"Any information regarding crimes committed in other jurisdictions has been or will be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agencies and the FBI for further investigation,\" he said.

Charles Crowther, of Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, was desperate to attend the unveiling of the memorial at Leeds Bradford International Airport (LBIA) in West Yorkshire but was told he would not be allowed through security. Next week's service is to be held for those killed in 609 (West Riding) Squadron during the war, which includes Charles's brother William, whose Wellington Bomber was shot down by a German plane in 1942. Charles Crowther, 99, cannot go to a WWII memorial ceremony in the departure lounge of Leeds Bradford International Airport (LBIA) to honour his hero brother William (black and white photo) because he hasn't got a passport or driving licence . Ground crew serviceman Charles Crowther (seen left in 1941) and flight engineer William (right, also in 1941) both served in 609 (West Riding) squadron . Speaking from his home Mr Crowther, who served in the same squadron, admitted he was devastated that the airport couldn't make an exception for him and let him attend the service. The former ground crew serviceman said: 'I can understand that there have to be safety checks but this might be the last time that I could go and commemorate my brother, so I'm upset I can't go. 'I'm 99 and so of course I'm not going to have a passport now or a driving licence. 'Unfortunately, this ceremony is taking place in a restricted part of the aerodrome - and I shan't be allowed in without these documents. William Crowther (pictured far left) in 1941 next to a Halifax bomber. He died when his Wellington Bomber was shot down by a German plane the following year . Charles (pictured eighth from right, in 1940) said he was devastated that the airport couldn't make an exception for him and let him attend the service . 'It feels awful that I can't attend a service to my own brother.' William, a flight engineer, died aged 30 when his Wellington Bomber was shot down on the way back from an air raid in Essen, Germany. He and his flight crew were just about to reach the Norfolk coast when a German shell hit the fuselage of the plane and exploded over the North Sea.

Charles's son, Peter, 65, has pleaded with the authorities to let his father pay tribute at the unveiling of a plaque on April 17 by the 609 Squadron Association. Both are pictured above . A spokeswoman for LBIA said that two ceremonies were taking place, but the first would be in the departure lounge which would require passport or driving licence identification for visitors to attend. Right, William Crowther's commemorative scroll . The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF from July to September 1940. It was one of the turning points of World War Two and prevented Germany from invading Britain. The battle began in mid-July with Luftwaffe concentrating on attacking shipping in the . English Channel and attacking coastal towns and defences. From August 12, Hermann . Goering, one of the leaders of the Nazi regime, shifted his focus to the . destruction of the RAF, attacking airfields and radar bases. (Pictured above, RAF scrambling to their planes in 1940.) Convinced that Fighter Command was . now close to defeat, he also tried to force air battles between fighter . planes to break British strength. But Goering grew frustrated by . the number of British planes still fighting off his . attacks. Luftwaffe switched tactics again and, on . Hitler's orders, set about destroying London and other major cities. Eleven days later, on what became 'Battle of Britain Day', the . RAF decimated the huge incoming Luftwaffe formations in the skies above . London and the south coast. Peter, of Fettercairn, Aberdeenshire, said: 'I don't know what to do about it. 'I just couldn't understand why a 99-year-old man would be treated this way. 'We've got plenty of proof about his identity, just not the two documents that are required and it seems mad that an exception couldn't have been made. 'The chairman of the 609 Squadron Association actually said I could get a passport for my father as they can be issued for free to anyone born before 1928. 'But when I said that he had lost his previous one, which he hadn't seen for 40 years, I was told that would take about six or seven weeks to sort out the paperwork which was far too long a process. 'It's just a bit of nonsense I think.' A spokeswoman for LBIA said that two ceremonies were taking place, but the first would be in the departure lounge which would require passport or driving licence identification for visitors to attend. She said: 'There are two plaques being unveiled at the airport on April 17 both commemorating the 609 (West Riding) Squadron. 'At 10am, a ceremony to reintroduce the restored plaque over a prayer of dedication in its new location will be held for original contributors and their immediate family. 'This is to take place airside within the departure lounge. 'A visitor pass needs to be issued for all attendees visiting the restricted areas and there are strict guidelines that the airport must comply with governing the issue of visitor passes - one element is an official form of identification. 'Both LBIA and the 609 Squadron Association have tried to assist the family in obtaining the required documents. 'At 11am on the same day, a second plaque will also be unveiled in the airport's main entrance landside. 'This brand new plaque not only commemorates the original 609 Squadron but also the squadron which re-formed in 1999 and still serves today. 'The family are very welcome to attend this event and have previously been encouraged to do so.'

His son, Peter, has pleaded with authorities to make an exception, but the airport maintains that strict security guidelines must be followed. A second, more accessible ceremony will be held at the airport's main entrance, which the family is welcome to attend. Charles's inability to attend the first ceremony has left him devastated, as it may be his last chance to pay tribute to his brother.\",\n",

Some 2,440 Chinese students taking a national exam have been caught using high-tech cheating gear that wouldn\\'t be out of place in a spy film. According to state media, invigilators detected abnormal radio signals that were being used to transmit the answers in code to candidates, who wore wireless ear pieces or placed \"electronic erasers\" on their desks. More than 25,000 students took the exam to become licensed pharmacists in the northwestern city of Xian on October 18 and 19. The test took place in seven separate locations. The organizers of the scam sent fake candidates to take the test, who quickly left after memorizing the questions. They then broadcast the correct answers to candidates, who had paid $330 for the service. Jiang Xueqin, a Beijing-based education consultant, said that China\\'s high-stakes, exam-focused educational system had led to a culture of cheating. \"Most examples are not as flagrant or as stark as this but cheating is widespread because the focus is on getting the certification, not the skills you need in the work place.\" Test centers for China\\'s notoriously competitive university entrance exam use metal detectors to clamp down on cheating devices, with security often tighter than at airports, he added. Nor do parents always frown upon such scams. In 2012, when authorities tried to stop cheats in the city of Zhongxiang in Hubei, a riot broke out involving parents angry that their children were being singled out when everyone was cheating. Those caught cheating in the national licensing exam would not be allowed to take the exam again for two years, said Du Fangshuai, head of the provincial examination department.',\n",

Jiang Xueqin, a Beijing-based education consultant, attributes the widespread cheating to China\\'s exam-focused educational system, where the emphasis is on obtaining certifications rather than practical skills. Security measures for such exams are often stringent, sometimes exceeding airport protocols, but parental attitudes can be lenient, as seen in a 2012 incident where parents rioted when authorities tried to stop cheating. Those caught in this latest scandal will be banned from retaking the exam for two years, according to Du Fangshuai, head of the provincial examination department.',\n",

The duped 64-year-old - named only as Jan - said he had 'no clue' his bride had been born a boy. The shocking revelation only emerged after almost two decades of marriage when a cousin from his wife's native Indonesia finally exposed the truth. Jan told how he met 'Monica' in 1993 when she arrived in his home town of Antwerp as an au-pair to his sister's children. Picturesque: The city of Antwerp, where the pair have lived since they married 19 years ago. The marriage is on the rocks after Jan discovered 'Monica' was born a man and had undergone a sex change operation . He described as her 'very beautiful and feminine' - but said he now understood why she was 'no good at ironing'. Jan told Belgium's Nieuwsblad daily paper: 'My second marriage was on the rocks at the time and we quickly fell in love. 'I thought she was an attractive woman, and she was all woman - she had no male traits. 'She was 27 years old at the time, so I asked her if she wanted children. 'I was glad when she said she didn't as I was 44 and already had two of my own. Deception: Monica was described as 'feminine' by her unknowing husband. The transsexual hails from Indonesia (pictured) 'Over the years she said she was taking the pill, and even during sex I never noticed anything, though now I understand why she always used a lubricant, which is apparently normal among transexuals. 'She was always a good mother to my children, and also a fantastic cook, though we wasn't that great at cleaning and ironing - and now I know why!' But Jan said the relationship had begun to suffer over the past two years as she insisted on staying out late on her own wearing 'very revealing outfits' He added: 'She would wear tiny tops that revealed a lot of flesh and had more than 100 pairs of shoes. 'I also caught her ogling pictures of young men on the Internet. 'But I didn't suspect a thing until a cousin of hers came to visit and let something slip. 'I mentioned it to my son and he said he'd heard a rumour too that Monica used to be a man. 'One evening I confronted her and she finally confessed she had been born a boy and had a sex change operation. 'My world collapsed in a few seconds. I was horrified. I feel like have been violated for almost 20 years.' The couple are still living under the same roof after a judge refused to grant Jan an order to evict her.

Ray Halbritter, a representative for the Oneida, said he gave NFL vice presidents Adolpho Birch, Paul Hicks and Jeff Pash a letter and a study on the effects of the Redskins name. \"We were somewhat disappointed to say it mildly that they continued to defend the use of the slur,\" he said. \"It really does require us to redouble our efforts in dealing with this issue.\" A statement from the NFL said the meeting was part of an \"ongoing dialogue.\" \"We listened and respectfully discussed the views of Mr. Halbritter, Oneida Nation Wolf Clan Representative Keller George and their colleagues, as well as the sharply differing views of many other Native Americans and fans in general,\" the NFL said, according to the statement. Halbritter said the letter asks for another meeting at the Super Bowl so he and the clinical psychologist who put together the study can address every NFL owner on the harm the Redskins name can cause. \"The use of the R-word is not just a victimless crime. It has very real and damaging effects on Native American youth,\" he said. Snyder has said the Redskins name will not change. \"After 81 years, the team name \\'Redskins\\' continues to hold the memories and meaning of where we came from, who we are, and who we want to be in the years to come,\" he wrote in a letter on the team\\'s website. The nickname is a \"badge of honor,\" he wrote. Besides the request for a Super Bowl meeting, Halbritter said the letter also asks Goodell to add an NFL rule that prohibits league franchises from naming teams with dictionary-defined racial slurs. The Oneida also want Goodell to sanction Snyder, if he doesn\\'t change the name. And they also invited Snyder and Goodell to come to Oneida land in central New York, the two-page letter says. The Washington Post reported that Snyder met with Goodell on Tuesday and the Washington owner reiterated he was keeping the Redskins name.',\n",

A pair of teenagers who allegedly tried to rob two university students at gunpoint are behind bars after their would-be victims fought back putting their assailants in hospital. When police arrived at the scene of the alleged robbery in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 27, they found Johnny Calderon Junior, 19, and Gerald Allen, 18, with beaten-up and bloodied faces. They were being held in the custody of two University of Virginia Students after allegedly trying to rob them at the 2300 block of Fonaine Avenue. Allegations: Johnny Calderon Junior (left) and Gerald Allen (right) are facing several charges including attempted robbery. The pair were hospitalized when their alleged victims fought back . According to NBC29.com, the pair were taken to hospital by ambulance for treatment, before being placed under arrest. Calderon Junior is facing two charges of attempted robbery, one for pointing a firearm and . one for using a firearm in a crime. He appeared in court on Friday. Allen is facing two charges of attempted robbery. He is due to appear in court on October 3. Both suspects were left with severe injuries. Allen was particularly badly beaten, and was unable to open one of his eyes for his police photo it was so badly swollen. Their alleged victims, who have not been named, are said to have escaped the fracas without injury. Charlottesville Police spokesman Ronnie Roberts said at this stage neither of the students will face charges because their actions were taken in self defence.

The next 30 years will see an ageing white population reduced from 75 per cent of U.S. citizens today to 49.7 per cent in 2044, the first year minorities will outnumber whites. In the same time period the Hispanic population will soar from 16 per cent today to 25 per cent, while the Asian population will nearly double from 4 per cent to 7.9 per cent. The year 2044 will mark the first time that ethnic minorities will outnumber white Americans, with the Hispanic population growing from 17 per cent now to 25 per cent, while the Asian population will nearly double . While whites will still be the single largest ethnic group in America by 2044, when all the minorities are added together, it will form a 'majority minority' population. That trend will continue into 2060 when white people will make up around 44 per cent of Americans, according to research by Brookings Institution. As younger generations opt for having fewer children, and delay parenthood into later life, deaths will begin to outnumber births in the white population by 2025, when numbers will start to decline. By 2060 white people will still make up the majority of the senior population, with 55 per cent of over 65s being white, but among the young that drops to 48 per cent, with 64 per cent being minorities. By 2060 white Americans will make up the majority of seniors, but among the young that drops to 48 per cent, with 64 per cent coming from minorities . During the next 50 years the number of Hispanic and Asian people will more than double, while the mixed race population will expand by more than three times, despite still making up the smallest single group. According to William Frey, \\xa0a researcher for Brookings, the new projections show a greater than expected increase in the Asian population, thanks in part to higher immigration, while the gain is slightly lower than expected for Hispanics, as the birth rate begins to decline. The black population will see only a modest increase between now and 2044, rising from 12.3 per cent according to the 2010 census, to 12.7 per cent according to this research. Guy Garcia, a spokesman for researchers Ethnifacts, told the Latin Post: 'Thirty percent all grandparents in America have a grandchild of a different race or ethnicity, and the diversity in this country is growing in so many ways, we are just starting to get a grasp on those changes. 'Gay parents, when they adopt, there is a high rate of multicultural adoptions. We have all these new variation and permutations of the American family.

However, among younger Americans, 64% will be from minority groups. The mixed-race population is also expected to more than triple, though it will remain the smallest single group.

They will remember the many images of Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi shaking hands and exchanging a warm embrace on the airport tarmac and at their first joint press conference in the world\\'s glare. The Indian media has dubbed it a \"bromance,\" evidence of the chemistry that aides on both sides have been at pains to point out for months. It seems like an eternity since the former leader of the Indian state of Gujarat was persona non grata in the U.S. And so the biggest takeaway from Obama\\'s three days in India was the symbolism of the leaders of the world\\'s two biggest democracies cozying up. But others would have seen greater geopolitical implications. As Obama watched the Republic Day parade, Beijing welcomed Pakistan\\'s army chief General Raheel Sharif for talks. Unlike Obama\\'s previous India visit in 2010, Pakistan was not a focus -- at least in public statements. Instead, India seems to be positioning itself for a more global role, playing a part in issues that go beyond its borders. There were some other tangible takeaways from the summit too -- though the exact details were a little fuzzy. Modi announced progress had been made on negotiations over a civil nuclear deal -- a new 10-year defense cooperation agreement between the two countries was announced -- which may have far-reaching consequences for both sides on sharing intelligence and military education, and there was much talk about boosting bilateral trade from its current level of around $100 billion a year to $500 billion by 2025. As with most summits between world leaders, what goes on behind the scenes before and after is probably more important -- at least in terms of detail. But let\\'s give symbolism its moment and its due. For millions of Indians who watched the events of the last three days -- and given the intense media coverage in India it would have been impossible to miss -- they will now slowly reassess their sense of India\\'s place in the world. As Obama departs India, a push for reform . Maybe that will help broaden India\\'s historically insular foreign policy thinking. Maybe it will make India a more prominent player in global issues, over time. And maybe, just maybe, India and the U.S. may move a little closer to forming the \"defining partnership\" that Obama first promised in 2010.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'Microsoft\\'s Bing search engine will not follow Google out of China. Executives have made that clear. But will they take the high road or the low road in their quest to win a bigger piece of a China\\'s fast-growing Internet market? On Monday Google stopped censoring its Chinese search engine and moved the service to Hong Kong, where the Internet isn\\'t censored. Before this week Google had a 35 percent share of the Chinese search engine market, a nontrivial number in a country of 400 million Internet users. It\\'s unlikely that many of those 140 million Google.cn users will stick with the new service at Google.com.hk, because many of its results are now blocked by the Chinese government\\'s own network-level censorship system, known as the \"Great Firewall of China.\" With the loyalty of millions of Chinese Internet searchers up for grabs, Baidu, the home-grown search engine with dominant market share in China, is expected to be the biggest winner. But Microsoft\\'s chief research and strategy officer, Craig Mundie, confirmed in an interview with the state-controlled China Daily last week that Bing, which now has less than 1 percent of Chinese market share, \"is committed to stay.\" He chided Google for its lack of experience in China compared with Microsoft\\'s 20-year presence, implying that one day it, too, will grow up to the world\\'s realities. But is Microsoft being ethically responsible? The answer to that question is not simply about whether Bing stays in China. It\\'s also a question of how Bing stays. Will Microsoft manage its legal obligations to the Chinese government in a way that helps legitimize and prolong current censorship practices, or in a way that helps reduce censorship over time -- or at the very least increases transparency and accountability to Chinese citizens? In January, the Chinese media gave prominent play to comments by Microsoft\\'s founder Bill Gates and CEO Steve Ballmer. Ballmer called Google\\'s move to stop censoring in China an irrational business decision. \"You\\'ve got to decide,\" said Gates, \"do you want to obey the laws of the countries you\\'re in, or not?\" In a blog post, Ballmer attempted to clarify Microsoft\\'s position. While Microsoft intends to stay engaged in the China market, he said it does try to push back quietly against efforts to restrict peaceful political expression. \"We have conversations with governments to make our views known,\" he wrote. \"In every country in which we operate, including China, Microsoft requires proper legal authority before we remove any Internet content; and if we remove content, we give users notice.\" Needless to say, those words were not quoted in the Chinese media. As it happens, the way Microsoft handles censorship in China has changed since it launched a Chinese version of its search engine and rolled out a Chinese-language blog-hosting service in 2005. Chinese Internet companies -- including Baidu -- routinely delete content in response to casual phone calls and instant chat messages made by authorities who don\\'t find it necessary to prove that their request has any legal basis. When Microsoft started in China, its approach to compliance could best be described as \"when in Rome, do as the Romans do.\" That year, their employees deleted a popular blog in response to a phone call made by a government official to Microsoft\\'s Chinese business partner. Microsoft employees didn\\'t just block the blog, which had called for a boycott of a newspaper after its editor was fired; they took it off the Internet completely. It was no longer visible to anybody in the world. In February 2006, executives from Cisco, Yahoo, Microsoft and Google were summoned to a congressional hearing in Washington. Google had announced its decision to enter China with a censored search engine, Google.cn. Cisco was under fire for selling technology to China that helped authorities censor the Internet. Yahoo! was in the doghouse for having helped authorities convict pro-democracy journalist Shi Tao and three other activists by handing over the contents of their e-mail to Chinese police. \"Your abhorrent activities in China are a disgrace,\" thundered the late California Democratic Rep. Tom Lantos. Executives justified their companies\\' behavior by saying they are bound to abide by the local laws where they do business. Then why, human rights activists and legal experts asked, were they responding to requests made by Chinese authorities using no pretense of legal process? Microsoft began to change the way it handles censorship. It says it has stopped taking down content every time Chinese authorities object. It claims to have instituted procedures stipulating that only legally binding requests made in writing would be honored. When carrying out requests to censor entries on MSN Spaces (later renamed MSN Live Spaces), Microsoft\\'s blogging and social networking platform, it would block pages from users on the Chinese network, but leave them visible to people viewing the page from all other countries. Tests I\\'ve conducted have shown that MSN Live\\'s Chinese service censors substantially less than its domestic Chinese competitors. Bing seems to censor a bit less than the Chinese Baidu but a bit more than Google.cn did. The criteria the company uses for deciding what to censor and what not to censor, however, are not clear. We have to take it at its word that it\\'s only responding to censorship requests made through a legally binding procedure. But an effort is under way to hold Microsoft publicly accountable to its promises. In 2008, Microsoft, along with Google and Yahoo, joined the Global Network Initiative (GNI, at globalnetworkinitiative.org), a group that has established a code of conduct for free expression and privacy. The goal of the initiative, whose members include human rights groups, investors and academics (including myself) is to help companies do the right thing under difficult circumstances. Figuring out the right thing to do can be particularly tough in countries like China, where people have so much to gain from greater access to global Internet platforms and tools, and the government works hard to co-opt companies to serve their purposes . As a member, Microsoft has signed on to a document that states: \"The right to freedom of expression should not be restricted by governments, except in narrowly defined circumstances based on internationally recognized laws or standards.\" While the initiative does not expect companies to make their local employees conduct civil disobedience or pull out of markets at the first sign of difficulty, the GNI does expect that companies will not comply with arbitrary requests and will seek to protect users from the kinds of surveillance that could lead to human rights violations. Member companies have agreed to submit to an independent evaluation process to determine whether their claims match the reality. Earlier this month, Chinese Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Yizhong told the international press that foreign Internet companies must obey Chinese laws. Now the question is: Will Microsoft take him at his word? Will Bing comply only with those censorship requests that have a clear basis in Chinese law and which are made through a legally binding, documented and accountable process? Will it challenge them? Will it do everything it can to avoid storing personally identifiable user data that can be shared with local authorities, and will it clearly inform its users about what information is kept about them and with whom it will be shared? When we know the answers to those questions, we\\'ll know which road Bing has taken in China. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rebecca MacKinnon .',\n",

Bing currently holds less than 1 percent of the Chinese search market, compared to Google's previous 35 percent share. With Google's departure, Baidu, the leading Chinese search engine, is expected to gain the most. Microsoft's chief research and strategy officer, Craig Mundie, emphasized the company's 20-year presence in China and its commitment to staying, suggesting that Microsoft is more attuned to the country's realities.\\n\\nThe ethical implications of Microsoft's decision are significant. The company must navigate its legal obligations to the Chinese government while balancing its commitment to free expression and transparency. Microsoft has taken steps to improve its handling of censorship, such as requiring legally binding requests in writing and blocking content only from the Chinese network. However, the criteria for censorship remain unclear, and the company's practices are being monitored by the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a group promoting free expression and privacy.\\n\\nMicrosoft's approach has evolved since 2005, when it deleted a popular blog in response to a casual government request.

But for those who love an adrenaline buzz, then \"step into the void\" -- a suspended glass cube with a transparent bottom overlooking the Alps. But it\\'s not for the fainthearted -- there\\'s a drop of over 3,300 feet (1,000 meters). A rival to the London Shard, which stands at 1,017 feet (310 meters) and offers a 360-degree view of the city, it is the latest piece of architecture to attract thousands of tourists. Designed by Pierre-Yves Chays, the structure is inspired by \"The Skywalk,\" a huge glass walkway overlooking the Grand Canyon in the U.S. state of Arizona. Perched at the top of the 12,600-foot (3,842-meter) Aiguille du Midi peak near Chamonix, France, it gives a view of Mont Blanc which had previously only been attainable by skiing. \"I don\\'t know if I can do it,\" were the first words to flash into the mind of Mathieu Dechavanne, the man who helped create the attraction. After three years of development, Compagnie Mont Blanc, the firm which operates the ski lifts and attractions in the area, has created a structure made from three layers of tempered glass which can withstand winds of up to 200 kilometers an hour. The stupendous view captures the highest peaks in France, Italy and Switzerland, as well as the biggest glaciers in Europe. \"The original idea was to create something even bigger to cross from one end to another,\" Dechavanne, general manager of Compagnie Mont Blanc, told CNN. \"One of the main conditions we had was that the design fitted in with the environment of the site. \"If that wasn\\'t possible, we wanted to do something to allow the visitor to step into the shoes of a mountaineer. \"We wanted people to understand what was going on at altitude. From the void, you can see people climbing and making their way up the mountain. \"You can also try to climb if you want but if you want the sensation of what it\\'s like at the top then try this transparent box and you can gain a real experience.\" While the view may be enough to send shivers down the spine, the journey to the very top might leave a few feeling queasy. To get to the top, patrons must brave a cable car ride which takes them 8,858 feet (2,700 meters) up the side of the mountain. Once that\\'s been completed, it\\'s on board a second cable car for the final 4,790 feet (1,460 meters) to ascend to the peak. \"The view is fantastic,\" added Dechavanne. \"The beauty is that the void is beneath the feet but the impact on the brain comes from the transparency of the glass.\" \"It\\'s not like walking in the street, but this gives the impression to people of what it\\'s like on the mountain.\" To compare how \"The Void\" compares to other viewing structures around the world, Toronto\\'s CN Tower -- named one of the modern world\\'s Seven Wonders by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1995 -- is 1,815 feet (553 meters) tall and its highest platform is at 1,465 feet (447 meters). It has since been overtaken by Shanghai\\'s World Financial Center, which has an observation deck at 1,555 feet (474 meters), and Guangzhou\\'s Canton Tower (1,601 feet, 488 meters). In 2012, the tallest hotel in the world was opened in Dubai -- the Marquis, standing at 1,164 feet (355 meters) tall -- while its owner Marriott recently unveiled its newest property in New York.

Both players are set to be among the major box-office attractions when Wales host the All Blacks next Saturday. Between them, they have scored 48 Test tries, but North’s fellow wing Savea has 29 of those from just 32 international appearances. All Blacks and Wellington Hurricanes winger Julian Savea has scored 29 tries in 32 Test matches . It is a staggering strike-rate, and one that is not lost on North. 'He is exceptional. He is a brilliant example of how to impose yourself on a game,' North said. 'He pops up left, right and centre. You have to watch to work out what to do, but learn from him as well. 'The All Blacks have shown over the past few weeks that they can win Test matches when they are really feeling the heat. Savea is widely regarded as the best winger in the world at present and has been compared to Jonah Lomu . 'They are deservedly number one in the world, and we have to step up our game massively for the weekend.” Wales have not beaten New Zealand since 1953, and given the sub-standard nature of their performance against Fiji two days ago, they will not be widely expected to end that long losing sequence this time around. Although Wales defeated the South Sea Islanders 17-13 - North was among their try-scorers - they did not register a point after half-time despite Fiji having prop Campese Ma’afu sent off. 'You are aware of what’s coming, and you work even harder,' North added. 'There is no bigger challenge than the All Blacks. George North crosses for an early try against Fiji last Saturday but Wales stuttered to a 17-13 victory . 'The All Blacks have a great game-plan. They’ve got players who can get over the gain-line, and they’ve got boys who are very good in the air and have great skills. They won’t bring anything less than that on the weekend. 'The boys are really excited for the next two games (against New Zealand and South Africa). 'It wasn’t ideal to go into this game on the back of that performance against Fiji, but it is better to go in with a win rather than a loss. Warren Gatland's side have a huge fortnight ahead of them when they face the All Blacks and South Africa . 'Everyone has held their hands up and we’ve said that we need to do better. We went out there believing in how we were set up and how we wanted to play, but we just didn’t get into our own rhythm. 'You don’t want to make eye contact with anyone in the debrief after a match like that. 'It’s part of the job. You are flying high on the good days and want to talk to everyone, but when the dark days come and you haven’t been performing, you have to man up and take it on the chin. 'A few boys, myself included, know that we didn’t perform as well as we should have with the space and time we had. You kick yourself when you look back over a lot of things, but you have to take it on the chin and make it right in the next game. 'Everyone involved on the weekend knew that the turnovers came from silly mistakes and they were schoolboy errors. The players are harder than anyone on themselves. 'I am very hard on myself, and those basic skills shouldn’t be a worry at this level. We had 23 turnovers from knock-ons, and you can’t afford to do that at this level with New Zealand and South Africa coming up.'\",\n",

The director of an Israeli legal outfit says yes, and is threatening to sue the micro-blogging site if it doesn\\'t change its policies. Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, director of the Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center, sent a letter to Twitter on Thursday asserting that the company is violating U.S. law by allowing groups such as Hezbollah and al Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab to use its popular online network. \"It has come to our attention that Twitter Inc. provides social media and associated services to such foreign terrorist organizations,\" Darshan-Leitner wrote. \"Please be advised that (doing so) is illegal and will expose Twitter Inc. and its officers to both criminal prosecution and civil liability to American citizens and others victimized\" by Hezbollah, al-Shabaab and other foreign terrorist entities. Twitter declined to comment when contacted by CNN. In her letter, Darshan-Leitner noted that Hezbollah and al-Shabaab are officially designated as terrorist organizations under U.S. law. She also cited a 2010 Supreme Court case -- Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project -- which upheld a key provision of the Patriot Act prohibiting material support to groups designated as terrorist outfits. \"Your provision of social media and associated services to Hezbollah and other foreign terrorist organizations would constitute the type of seemingly innocuous material support that would render your company and you personally criminally and civilly liable,\" she told Twitter CEO Richard Costolo. Hezbollah-controlled al-Manar television currently maintains a Twitter account with roughly 7,500 followers. Other groups considered terrorist organizations by the United States also maintain accounts. Hamas, the Islamist group that rules the Gaza Strip, posts regularly on at least one government-controlled account. Darshan-Leitner says she realizes there will be stiff opposition to a potential lawsuit from free speech advocates, but told CNN she nevertheless hopes Twitter will change its policies. \"Once you bring it to their attention, they cannot say that they don\\'t know,\" she said. Aden Fine, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, told CNN that the Supreme Court \"has not directly addressed the issue of whether any speech allegedly supportive of a designated terrorist organization is unlawful.\" But \"the government can\\'t force private companies to censor lawful speech just because the government doesn\\'t like the speech or the people making the speech,\" he said. Fine noted that since the Internet depends on private companies such as Twitter to function, any clampdown or adverse ruling could be used to restrict everyone\\'s online communications. Social networks Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have been lauded for the role they played in the Arab Spring, a series of anti-regime protests that erupted across the Middle East starting in late 2010. The online networks and instant messaging services were used extensively to spread the word about demonstrations, especially in the case of the Egyptian uprising that toppled longtime strongman President Hosni Mubarak. A number of governments, however, have started arguing for stricter controls. Authorities in the United Kingdom say rioters used social the networks to coordinate mass civil disobedience earlier this year in London. State prosecutors in Mexico have accused two people of terrorism and sabotage by claiming that their Twitter posts helped spread false rumors about a school attack, leading to real-life violence on the streets of Veracruz. The Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center describes itself as a civil rights organization dedicated to \"combating the terrorist organizations and the regimes that support them through lawsuits litigated in courtrooms around the world.\" It supported a similar campaign earlier this year directed at social media giant Facebook. Among other things, the center succeeded in getting Facebook to pull down a page created by Palestinian activists calling for a \"Third Intifada\" against Israel.

A grandfather burned to death inside an industrial oven that baked plastic at up to 280 degrees after he became trapped and the machine was turned on by his future son-in-law, a court heard. Alan Catterall, 54, from Runcorn, Cheshire,\\xa0had gone into the oven to fix a fault when operator Mark Francis, not realising he was still working inside, switched the machine on and locked him in. Mr Francis was engaged to Mr Catterall's eldest daughter, the jury was told. Liverpool Crown Court heard that because there was no alarm Mr Catterall tried to escape using a crowbar but because of the noisy working environment no one heard his cries for help. Colleagues at Pyranha Mouldings Ltd only discovered 'the problem was when smoke started seeping out of the oven,' the jury heard. The father-of-three died after suffering severe burns and shock following the incident on 23 December 2010. The company's oven was used to make kayaks. Pyranha is now on trial charged with corporate manslaughter with the directors and a self-employed engineer facing charges related to health and safety breaches. Andrew Thomas, QC, prosecuting, said: 'The circumstances of Mr Catterall's death are quite horrific. 'On the morning of the accident a fault had developed in one of the ovens and it was out of action for about an hour whilst repair work was carried out. 'The initial fault was fixed and one of the operators turned the machine back on. 'Tragically, what the operator did not realise was that Mr Catterall was still working inside the oven. 'The design of the oven was such that the moment it was switched on its power-operated doors shut and automatically locked with metal bolts on the outside. 'Mr Catterall was trapped within the oven. There was no means of escape and no alarm. 'The oven is lined with insulation material, and on the noisy factory floor, there was no chance of anyone hearing his cries for help. Court case: Directors at Pyranha Mouldings Ltd in Runcorn, Cheshire, and the oven's designer are on trial after Alan Catterall died there in 2010 . 'After a preparation cycle lasting several minutes, the burners were turned on and the oven was raised to operating temperature. 'The evidence indicates that Mr Catterall made efforts to escape using a metal crow bar, but it was to no avail. 'He suffered severe burns and died as a result of shock. The first anyone knew about the problem was when smoke started seeping out of the oven.' Mr Catterall grew up in Liverpool and worked at a tyre factory in Speke before joining the Ford factory in Halewood where he worked for many years. He joined Pyranha in 1997 and was promoted to team leader at the company - which had between 90 and 100 employees - where his wife Pearl and daughter also worked. The company managing director Graham Mackereth, 64, from Runcorn, his brother and technical director Peter Mackereth, 59, from Llangollen, Wales, and self-employed electrical engineer Paul Keddie, from Wales, who designed the ovens, all deny health and safety breaches.

              "  {'content': '\"Release the models!\" The stage manager\\'s voice fills the backstage area, busy with hairstylists and makeup artists wielding the tools of their trade over a row of girls in front of brightly lit mirrors. \"It\\'s time for a quick run-through.\" It takes an extra moment for Petra Vujevic to break free from her chair, where she is surrounded by three stylists trying to tame her long blonde hair into a \"punky ballerina\" bun. The head stylist is teasing sections of her natural hair while another tends to neon pink extensions woven into her ponytail. A third handles clips and brushes. Vujevic winces. It hasn\\'t been a good hair day for the 20-year-old Croatian model. It\\'s the second time today that her head has been pulled in a million directions, loaded down with gooey products and hairspray. But she refrains from pouting because it\\'s part of the job. Anyway, modeling isn\\'t her life -- not yet, at least. It\\'s just something she decided to try by taking a year off from university in Croatia, where she\\'s studying computer science. She started exactly one year ago, making the rounds in Milan, Paris, London and Spain before arriving in New York three weeks ago for Fashion Week. A \"Man Repeller\\'s\" influence on display at New York Fashion Week . \"When you\\'re tall and thin, everyone says you should be a model, so I thought: try it for a year,\" Vujevic said in accented English, which she learned in school and from television. \"It\\'s been good. I decided to model because it was completely different. How would I know if I didn\\'t try?\" She hit the ground running in New York, averaging 15 castings a day and scoring not only a few shows during New York Fashion Week but jobs for catalogs and ads campaigns while in town. She plans on returning to her parents\\' home outside the Croatian capital of Zagreb to resume school in October. Vujevic may not be the typical small-town girl trying to make it in the big city, but her story underscores the bigger picture in the post-supermodel era, when girls are cycled in and out with each season and only a rare few stick around to become bold-face names. But her agency has high hopes for her. Lots of girls are tall, thin and beautiful, but Vujevic has an \"X presence,\" said Louise Roberts of APM Models, which represents Vujevic in the United States. \"Our clients look for that classically beautiful girl that has a different edge to her, something that no one can define,\" Roberts said. \"We loved the spirit in Petra\\'s photographs, the connection she had with the camera. In her eyes, you just saw there was a sparkle there. When you look at her, you have a sense that this girl can be successful.\" But Vujevic is simply living in the moment. And right now, it\\'s time for a quick practice walk on the runway. The stage manager yells again for the girls, and Vujevic joins the line of models near the backstage runway entrance. With their hair and makeup in various states of readiness, they look like a disheveled flock of flamingos stepping to the beat of singer/designer Avril Lavigne, who is nowhere in sight even though the show bears the Canadian rocker\\'s name and her brand\\'s imprint, Abbey Dawn. The collection, a swirling motif of skulls, rainbows, pleather and studs, isn\\'t exactly Vujevic\\'s speed, but she\\'s still excited to take part in this kind of production. It\\'s completely different from Rachel Antonoff\\'s garden party-themed presentation Sunday, in which Vujevic\\'s prop was a badminton racket, or the Christine Alcalay presentation earlier that day, which was staged in a 1,000-square-foot studio in an office building. For that job, she wakes at 7 a.m. Monday, showers and puts on just a bit of mascara and concealer. She takes a cab to the Garment District, arriving at the 11th floor whitewashed studio about two hours before showtime. It\\'s not a runway show but a \"presentation,\" in which the models will be dressed and positioned on the showroom like living mannequins. For now, the corner studio with lots of natural light pouring through the windows is a backstage area for hair and makeup. Eventually, it will transition into a showroom with music from a live violinist, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of an art gallery. Vujevic takes a seat, and a makeup artist gets to work on her face while a nail technician applies heated \"nail shields\" that behave like stickers. As she moves on to hair, the benches and makeup tables are removed, and risers are brought in to begin setting up the showroom. Twenty minutes later, her hair is done, and the tables are pushed back to a wall. A curtain goes up, creating an impromptu changing area for the designer to dress the girls. She emerges in a set of light blue shorts, blazer and shell. \"It\\'s not really my style, very businesswoman,\" she says. \"Maybe in 10 years.\" Once the models are clothed, a set designer arranges them on the floor while stylists dart around with spray cans and makeup brushes, putting on the final touches. Then, it\\'s time for the girls to stand in place for an hour as fashion editors and store buyers survey the collection. When a camera focuses on Vujevic, she narrows her eyes ever so slightly. About a half-hour in, she leaves the floor for the curtained changing area and returns in a tan calf-length skirt and lace cut-out halter top. She stands some more, occasionally shifting her weight to keep the circulation flowing. As the clock hits noon, some of the girls relax their rigid poses and wait for the cue to leave. Vujevic thought she would have a stretch of time for lunch -- modeling makes her hungry, she says -- but as she\\'s leaving the studio, her agency sends an e-mail letting her know that she has a fitting for Gerlan Jeans, so she heads downtown. On the ride over, she talks about this being her first time in the United States. She has noticed that fast food is really cheap, healthy food is expensive and everything seems to be labeled \"organic.\" She wishes she had more time to eat in restaurants and try new things but since she arrived in New York, she\\'s only had two days off to explore. In the studio on Bowery, she tries on two looks for the designer\\'s \"Gerl Power\" presentation, which is part Minnie Mouse, part activist, designer Gerlan Marcel says. Vujevic\\'s childlike features and height make her ideal for the show\\'s cartoon-y look, Gerlan says. As she tries on two of the designer\\'s neoprene looks, a bright yellow dress and a blue coat, Gerlan squeals in delight. \"When I was a little girl my favorite doll was named Petra and I carried her around with me everywhere,\" the designer explains as Vujevic struts down the narrow path in between racks of clothing and accessories littering the floor. \"Petra has come to life!\" Gerlan and her team agree that the yellow dress is too short for the 5\\'11 model and settle on the blue coat. Vujevic bids them farewell and runs downstairs to head over to the Metropolitan Pavilion for Lavigne\\'s show. The contrast from the morning\\'s gig couldn\\'t be more severe. The intimate austerity of the open studio has been replaced with a massive showroom of folding chairs surrounded by booths for Monster Energy drink and thinkThin energy bars, with a bright white runway in the middle. Getting her hair to cooperate and putting on her face leaves about 10 minutes to breathe before the show. On the way to the bathroom, she picks up a salted caramel chocolate from the Stoli Vodka booth. Lavigne eventually shows up about 30 minutes before showtime to thank the girls and pose for pictures. As they line up, she walks around adjusting their bows and belts and other small details. The show is over in 10 minutes, and Vujevic is already 30 minutes late for her next job in SoHo. She fills a plastic cup with vegetables before hustling outside to grab a cab to the Soho Grand Hotel for a presentation by menswear designer and self-described \"urban emperor\" Dominic Louis. Again, the setting couldn\\'t be more different. She walks up a flight of stairs to the hotel bar, which has been transformed into backstage hair and makeup area. The constant loop of \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"Girlfriend\" has been replaced by Siouxsie and the Banshees and Coldplay playing softly in the background. A woman is ironing pants where the waiter station would normally be; models rest their hands on the marble-topped bar to get their nails done. She takes a seat on a plush stool of dark wood while two stylists set to work blowing out her hair to remove product. She picks at a plate of cheese in her lap while they pull her hair into a tight ponytail at the crown of her head and fashion it into a bun. The tip of her hair is pulled into an avant garde cowlick. A makeup artist hands her a cloth to remove her makeup while she waits for a seat at the bar. Eventually, her face is transformed into a pale, white-lined canvas best summed up as extraterrestrial. There\\'s no private changing area here, so she quickly strips and changes into a black top and pants with its calves cut out. She\\'s paraded out with the rest of the models to a corridor and placed on a riser against a column. She stands there for an hour while an art house film plays and attendees in leather black shorts and vests take her picture. Eventually, she moves to the stage in front of the film screen with other models who are growing impatient. Finally, one of the models starts clapping, and the audience follows. The models seize the opportunity to step down and leave the corridor. It\\'s 11 p.m. now, and Vujevic is tired. Modeling is exciting but exhausting, she says. Will she return to modeling after she finishes school? \"It\\'s possible,\" she says. \"But maybe not for New York Fashion Week.\"',\n",

              "  {'content': 'It was still dark when Stan Brock began calling out numbers on his megaphone to admit a crowd of hundreds gathered at a Los Angeles sports arena Tuesday morning. A mobile health clinic offering free services has drawn thousands of people in Los Angeles in the last week. \"We opened the door at 5:30 and there were 600-odd people already gathered,\" he told CNN. Over the last week, thousands seeking free medical care have turned up at the mobile health care clinic set up by Remote Area Medical, a non-profit organization founded by Brock. Tuesday marks the final day of its eight-day operation in Los Angeles, which so far has resulted in the provision of at least $2 million in free health care services, according to Brock\\'s early estimates. Remote Area Medical, better known as RAM, is a volunteer organization that brings free medical, dental and vision care to people around the world.  See other groups that provide much-needed health services » . Since its launch in 1985, RAM has sent expeditions to developing corners of the world, including Haiti, the Dominican Republic and India. But in recent years, the Knoxville, Tenn.-based organization has faced increasing demand for its services in the U.S., including from large urban areas. \"We\\'ve had to cut back on services to needy places like Haiti because of overwhelming need in the U.S.,\" Brock told CNN. \"We have to take care of the home front first.\" On the final day of the Los Angeles operation, Brock said crowds were still gathering with the hope of receiving care. Patients have spent hours waiting in line in the past week for the chance to get free care. RAM has had to turn away some patients because it didn\\'t have enough volunteers to provide treatment. It hasn\\'t reached its target of treating 1,500 patients a day, but Brock still considers the operation a success. He said RAM has treated at least 4,557 people, and that doesn\\'t include figures from the last two days of the operation, which aren\\'t available yet, he said. Many patients have used more than one service, resulting in roughly 11,500 patient encounters. That includes the extraction of nearly 1,800 bad teeth and the production of 1,090 pairs of new eyeglasses. While limited access to health care is often associated with developing countries, it\\'s a problem that faces patients around the world. That\\'s become increasingly clear as America debates the future of health care. Los Angeles is by far the largest urban community RAM has served so far. The organization has been besieged for requests from a number of metro areas, including Detroit, Seattle, Miami and Atlanta, Brock said. The lack of accessible health care from an economic standpoint is a problem that has been going on for decades, Brock said. \"We could have come to Los Angeles 15 years ago and I guarantee there would have been just as big of a turnout of patients,\" he told CNN. Brock started RAM after spending 15 years in what used to be British Guiana -- now known as Guyana -- in South America. In that isolated area, it would take 26 days on foot to reach care, Brock recalled, and he wanted to find a way to bring medical care to such remote areas. RAM usually provides services in the Appalachia region of the U.S. where it\\'s easier for volunteers to work, Brock said. Medical practitioners providing free care in Tennessee can be licensed in any state. Unfortunately, he said, other states don\\'t have similar provisions, making it difficult for RAM to recruit enough local volunteers to be able to deal with the demand if they were to set up in areas like New York or Washington. Running the temporary clinic is practically a 24-hour operation. Brock\\'s day starts at 4 a.m. and runs well into the night. But it\\'s a rewarding experience for volunteers when they get to see how much their efforts have been appreciated, he said. \"When you see a patient who has had thousands of dollars of free dental care come out of a dental chair and they\\'ve got tears in their eyes and hug the dentist and dental assistant, it makes it all worthwhile.\"',\n",

He had to be reared by the zoo keepers six days after his birth because his mother, 'Hecla' wasn't producing enough milk to sustain her infant . 'Life has become a blur of nappies, milk formula and sleepless nights and our veterinary department now features a portacot, having been turned into a temporary nursery - it's certainly a labour of love.' Tipping the scales at a healthy 860g, Owa is currently having six bottle feeds a day and has just started tucking into mashed fruit and vegetables. Owa visits his mother and father, Jury, and four-year old sister ,Sunda, at least twice a day. The staff are very protective of the little fella and it is anticipated that he will return to his family once he is old enough and weaned off his milk feeds. Owa is Hecla’s tenth offspring and along with her mate Jury, the animals are the world’s most successful known breeding pair of Javan Gibbons.

Perth Zoo is responsible for the coordination of the Studbook for this unique species which involves updating the international studbook for Javan Gibbon and advising on suitable breeding and genetics for this species throughout Australasia. Javan Gibbons, also known as Silvery Gibbons are Java’s last remaining ape and are endangered due to habitat destruction and the pet trade. Surveying techniques of wild Javan Gibbons is difficult but it is suspected there are less than 2000 remaining in the wild. Over 98 per cent of their original habitat has been destroyed for the growing population of Java that was recorded at 141 million people in 2012. Perth Zoo supports the work of Silvery Gibbon Project through its Wildlife Conservation Action fundraising program. The Silvery Gibbon Project assists with releasing gibbons into West Java’s Mt Malabar and educates the local community about the importance of habitat preservation and gibbon conservation.

              "  {'content': 'They are global sporting superstars, and they\\'ve got a story to tell. From former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson to ex-England captain David Beckham it seems everyone is releasing autobiographies in a blaze of promotion and headline grabbing excerpts -- and all in time for Christmas. But whether the intention is to set the record straight, settle a few old scores or simply tell it like it is, the majority tend to live and die by their ghost writer. Trying to capture the authenticity of the subject\\'s voice and cram the book full of interesting anecdotes can be a daunting task. But with the help of one respected author of several big football autobiographies, Ian Ridley, whose book on former England captain Tony Adams sold a million copies, here are 10 key components to a successful sporting tome. Story telling . Perhaps the most obvious commandment for any sporting book is that the subject matter has to be interesting. While a big name can usually be guaranteed to bring with them a loyal following who will buy whatever they release, the more casual observer needs a little more persuasion. Ridley\\'s most famous subject was former England soccer captain Tony Adams, who famously battled alcohol addiction throughout the most successful parts of his career. Another focused on former footballer Steve Claridge\\'s issues with betting while his most recent, on former English Premier League referee Mark Halsey dealt with his recovery from cancer. \"The subject of the book has to be honest about these things,\" Ridley told CNN. \"As a writer you have to press ever detail out of them and make sure you draw out the material.\" Capture the voice . Any book must bring the character to life in their own words -- it is no good having David Beckham hypothesizing over the French renaissance period. But get the ex-England captain talking about the influence of Alex Ferguson on his career or any of his famous \\'hairdryer\\' moments and people will be gripped. \"You have to capture their voice,\" Ridley explains. \"Ghostwriting is much more of a skill than is recognized.\" One good example is the recent autobiography of Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, entitled \\'I am Zlatan\\', that manages to captures his supreme confidence. For instance, the Paris Saint-Germain forward, who continually refers to himself in the third person, notes: \"An injured Zlatan is a properly serious thing for any team.\" Mining the seam . The odd five minute chat here or there isn\\'t going to cut it -- an author needs to live and breathe his subject for months if not years. That dictum is especially crucial if your sporting figure isn\\'t particularly effusive at the outset -- as the relationship between the two grows so does the material. \"With the Adams book (the process) took about 18 months,\" Ridley said. \"Don\\'t forget this was in the days before the Internet, which meant research was a lot more time consuming. Initially we did three months of interviews -- about 40 hours of tape.\" Lessen outside influences . Obviously, the publisher is king in the process but Ridley says it is important to keep their influence -- and pressure -- to a minimum. \"I have never been under pressure from a publisher and I have never extended a deadline,\" he said. \"As a journalist you are used to meeting deadlines and of course you don\\'t get paid until you deliver the manuscript. \"I have never been told how to structure a book, though in the editing process they might come back and say we need more of this and we would have a discussion about that.\" Any publicity is good publicity . That old adage rings true even more than ever in the instant digital world of today. Despite huge chunks of Ferguson\\'s books being reproduced -- much to the chagrin of his ghostwriter Paul Hayward -- it helped get the juicier bits of the text out in front of the public. \"You get worried they are ignoring the depth of the book,\" Ridley says. \"Such is the difficulty of selling books. But any publicity is good publicity. \"There isn\\'t the bravery or the courage anymore in publishing especially with anything that isn\\'t mainstream.\" Drown out the detractors . Any autobiography worth its weight is bound to offend someone or other -- the more the better in terms of publicity -- but it is important the author sticks to his guns. Ridley\\'s book on Adams contained a plethora of sensational snippets from the footballer\\'\\'s life, not all of them savory and saccharine. When the proofs were sent to David Dein -- then former vice-president of Adams\\' club Arsenal -- he was deeply unhappy says Ridley and was worried it painted the club in a bad light. But after pointing out the consequences to Dein of attempting to gag Adams, Ridley saw the ex-Arsenal vice-president\\'s attitude completely change upon the book\\'s publication. \"When the book was released Dein came over to me with a smile on his face and said it was flying off the shelves in the club shop. He was delighted.\" Get it serialized . Any self respecting autobiography must be trailed in a leading national newspaper to ensure maximum coverage ahead of its release. Not only does this help to prick the nation\\'s consciousness it can provide some valuable income in a world where the digital market is shredding the publishing industry slowly and steadily. Serialization deals sometimes outweigh the advance for a book thanks to a lot of big names releasing books than turned out to be big duds. \"The publishing industry is in a mess in terms of the digital revolution, especially selling books in hard cover and paperback,\" Ridley said. \"Publishers have been burnt by ordinary sports books that were so dull, but that huge sums had been paid for. Now advances are very poor and you get what you can for serialization rights.\" Press the flesh . Despite smashing UK sales records by selling 115,547 in its first week of release and making £1.4 million ($2.24m), Ferguson is still hitting the road for a series of speaking events to promote his autobiography. All but one of the six dates dotted around the UK have sold out and cost £40 a ticket, which includes a signed copy of the book that is currently retailing at £25 ($40). Not only does this help with sales but it also helps to keep Ferguson and his book in the public eye, with many newspapers -- both regional and national -- covering the events. Embrace the digital revolution . These days social media plays a huge role in the promotion of sports books with Twitter and Facebook campaigns an integral part of any launch. As part of Beckham\\'s media blitz the public were invited to a \\'global book signing\\' via the former Los Angeles Galaxy star\\'s Facebook page, whch has 30.5 million \\'likes.\\'. Fans from across the globe were able to get a personalized digital autograph on e-books from Beckham, during a session that included a question and answer section. \"I always like innovative and original ideas,\" said Beckham. \"What has been created is ambitious but it should be a fantastic event. \"I love the interaction with my fans, but not only will I be able to do this in London, I will be able to sign for them in locations across the world.\" Be determined . An extension of \\'drowning out the detractors\\' includes a commitment to getting the book out on the streets in the first place. When Ridley and Halsey lost a publishing deal they determined to print it themselves -- in Lithuania. There followed three months of under-the-radar work that felt like the plot of a spy novel,\" Ridley said. \"For guns, read books. I was introduced to a middle man who ran the merchandise to printers in Lithuania.\" But the hard work has been worth it with Halsey\\'s book garnering bags of column inches in the media and plenty of publicity. Ian Ridley is the author of Mark Halsey\\'s autobiography Added Time: Surviving Cancer, Death Threats and the Premier League.',\n",

The rate of circumcisions performed on newborn boys in U.S. hospitals dropped 6 per cent over the past three decades, with an especially steep decline in Western states, according to U.S. government data released Thursday. The national rate declined to 58.3 per cent in 2010 from 64.5 per cent in 1979, according to the report from the National Center for Health Statistics. The tally excludes many circumcisions, including those performed in other places such as religious institutions and those performed later in life. All time low: Baby circumcisions are becoming less frequent across the U.S. with a 6 per cent drop over the past three decades . Broadly, rates fell during the 1980s, increased in the 1990s, and fell again in the early 2000s. During the period covered by the data, male newborn circumcision was most common in 1981, at 64.9 per cent, and least common in 2007, at 55.4 per cent. Circumcision is a ritual obligation for infant Jewish boys and is also a common rite among Muslims, who account for the largest share of circumcised men worldwide. The wider U.S. population adopted the practice due to potential health benefits, such as reducing the risk of urinary tract infections in infants and cutting the risk of penile cancer and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Still, the practice has been the subject of heated debate, including efforts to ban circumcision in San Francisco and Germany. The American Academy of Pediatrics said last August that the health benefits of infant circumcision outweigh the risks of the surgery. The National Center for Health Statistics offered little explanation in the report for the falling rates but said fluctuations over the years followed changes to the American Academy of Pediatrics' assessment of the procedure's medical value. The center's findings were based on annual discharge data of between 7,000 and 12,000 newborn boys at between 250 and 550 U.S. short-stay, non-federal hospitals. In Western states, the rate dropped to 40.2 per cent in 2010 from 63.9 per cent in 1979, the center said. Rates in the Northeast were flat overall. In the Midwest, they mirrored national trends. In the South, they increased from 1979 until 1998 and then declined. A variety of factors could be at work. The federal Medicaid program for the poor has stopped paying for circumcisions in some 18 U.S. states, and some insurers have balked at paying for a procedure without a strong medical justification. Hospitalization lengths over the decades for mothers and newborns have come to be measured in hours, rather than days, prompting more circumcisions to be done in outpatient settings, said Douglas Diekema, a professor of pediatrics at Seattle Children's Hospital. The margin of error varies across the data in the report. The national rate, for example, has a relative standard error of roughly 3 percent to 5 percent.\",\n",

A spokesperson for NBC did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for comment. Mr Bell, who had worked for the show . since 2005, was responsible for the choice to broadcast this summer’s . Olympics on a delay, so that the events shot live in London would then . be shown at prime time in the U.S. The executive decision caused . outrage, as viewers missed out on London’s Opening Ceremonies, gymnast . Gabby Douglas’ stunning gold medal-winning performance, and sprinter . Usain Bolt’s 100m victory hours after they actually happened. Bell will go on to be the full-time executive producer of the network's Olympic coverage. He was also responsible for what many . thought was an offensive overlook of a national moment of silence on . the 11th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Rather than . airing the moment, the TODAY show aired a segment with Kardashian . matriarch Kris Jenner talking about her breast implants. Wrong direction? Matt Lauer, pictured today with Harry Styles of One Direction, left, and Savannah Guthrie, right; Lauer is said to be upset over the new executive producer . Smiling: Matt Lauer attended TIME's Person of the Year panel on Tuesday in New York . NBC is expected to officially announce . the departure of Bell soon, after the morning program lost its 16-year . consecutive ratings win to the competition. The . set at Studio 1A in New York's Rockefeller Center has been in a state . of constant flux, with a revolving door among the cast and a lack of . viewer confidence in the show that once dominated morning television. New York Times media reporter Brian Stelter broke the news on Monday, citing unnamed sources who said Alexandra Wallace, now a senior vice president of NBC News, will succeed Bell and become the first female EP of the morning program. Sources suggested to the Associated Press that Wallace will assume the role on an interim basis, while the Peacock Network searched for a replacement. But NBC insiders have remained tight-lipped about when the forthcoming changes could take effect at 30 Rock. Stelter spun the story on Twitter to highlight the fact that Bell is expected to assume a full time role producing the upcoming Olympics but the move is seen as a clear sign that Bell is taking the fall for the pandemonium on set that has been turning off viewers. Bad morning: After rumors of tension on the set, Ann Curry announced on June 28th that she was leaving the Today Show in an emotional farewell that left viewers squeamish . Not pleased: Though Matt Lauer tried to assure Curry of her contributions to the show, it was clear to viewers that she was shown the door . Bell, who started his career as a sport's producer, took the helm at Today seven years ago - taking on the role when the show was at the height of its success in 2005. The program has long been seen to be untouchable with its 16-year lead among viewers but ABC's Good Morning America has given the NBC show a run for their money. In April, Today lost in the ratings battle to GMA, which has grown in popularity among the am sect with its full-loving crew of Robin Roberts and George Stephanopoulos. In response to the crushing loss, Today said farewell to Ann Curry, who was crowned the co-host of the show in 2011 after serving as the newsreader for years, but her unceremonious exit did not sit well with viewers. 'This is not as I expected to ever leave this couch,' she said on June 28, when she gave an emotional goodbye to viewers. Rumors were rampant that Matt Lauer, the long serving co-host, had been unhappy with Curry's performance and had pushed for her departure but Bell came forward as the fall guy, saying he had decided to push Curry out. 'We made some tough calls,' Bell told The Hollywood Reporter in a soul-baring interview in September. Winning: Good Morning America raced ahead of Today in the ratings. The GMA crew (pictured in August left to right) Josh Elliott, Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos and Lara Spencer enjoy their newfound success . 'I think it’s really unfortunate how that played out,' he continued about the drama over Curry's ouster. 'Obviously the transition didn't go quite as we had hoped,' he conceded, admitting that viewers may have been turned off by how the episode played out. 'Matt, I need to say for the record, . really should not bear any of the blame for that. I’m the executive . producer of the show. He’s not. He’s the public face of the show, so . he’s taken some of this. But it has been wrong. And that fact should be . corrected.' 'I think it’s really unfortunate how that played out. Obviously the transition didn't go quite as we had hoped' -Jim Bell in September about the network's changes to the show . Despite the bad press about the show's direction, he expressed confidence (at least, at that time) in the future. 'We’re taking some shots. But that’s OK. We have the right team in place now. We’re just trying to move forward here.' But . even with his assurances that Lauer was not the bad guy, Lauer became . cast as a bit of a diva when reports emerged he negotiated a lucrative . contract, estimated at $25 million, that reportedly allowed him to cut . back on his work schedule despite his pay increase. Former . lawyer turned cheery TV personality, Savannah Guthrie, was named . Curry's replacement in July and even with her girl-next-door charm and . astute reporting abilities, the show has continued to struggle alongside . the competition. Tension: Savannah Guthrie (left) joined the show this summer but Matt Lauer has reportedly been micromanaging decisions on set, frustrating the rest of the crew . Bad timing? At the precise moment that CBS and ABC were broadcasting the moment's . silence to commemorate 9/11 from, NBC's TODAY show was airing an interview with Kris Jenner about breast implants . Users of Twitter took to the social networking site to express their disgust over the perceived lack of respect from NBC in broadcasting an interview with Kris Jenner instead of the 9/11 moment of silence at 8.46. a.m. After taking a hit to their ratings, Lauer . addressed the show's decline in a CNN interview in May and took . responsibility for its lackluster performance. ‘Perhaps we have let up on in the . past couple of years ... the competition is tougher and there are a lot . of challenges out there,’ he said on Piers Morgan Tonight on May 30. 'When people start to write articles . about what might be wrong with the Today show you know where you should . point the finger, point it at me because I have been there the longest. And it's my responsibility,’ he added. But with a new side-kick, reports circulated that Lauer saw himself as the show's savior and began micromanaging decisions on set at 30 Rock, much to the chagrin of the show's crew.\",\n",

              "  {'content': 'Matt Lauer, host of NBC’s TODAY show, is reportedly unhappy with the decision to replace executive producer Jim Bell with Alexandra Wallace, according to sources close to the situation. Bell, who has been with the show since 2005, is being phased out amid declining ratings and internal turmoil. Wallace, a longtime supporter of ousted co-host Ann Curry, is expected to take over as the first female executive producer of the morning program. Lauer, who has had a strained relationship with Wallace, is concerned about her plans to use a broader range of experts, contrary to his preference for NBC-paid experts. Bell\\'s tenure was marked by controversial decisions, including the delayed broadcast of the 2012 London Olympics and the omission of the 9/11 moment of silence in favor of an interview with Kris Jenner. The show has struggled to maintain its long-standing ratings lead, losing to ABC\\'s \"Good Morning America\" in April. Despite Lauer\\'s efforts to address the show\\'s decline, the transition has been rocky, with ongoing tensions and a revolving door of cast changes.',\n",

Orwah Hammad, who grew up in New Orleans and traveled to the West Bank when he was six, was shot in the head, as violence flares in Jerusalem and the West Bank. On Wednesday, a Palestinian drove a car through a train station in Jerusalem, killing a three-month-old infant — also an American citizen\\xa0— and injuring eight in what police called a terrorist attack. Killed: Orwah Hammad, 14, became the second teenager killed in the West Bank by Israeli Defense Forces when he was shot in the head on Friday . Conflicting reports have surfaced regarding the circumstances of Hammad's shooting. Soldiers 'managed to prevent an attack when they encountered a Palestinian man hurling a molotov cocktail at them on the main road next to Silwad,' an anonymous spokesperson for the Israeli army told Reuters. Hammad's cousin Moath claims that he was with a group of Palestinian boys throwing rocks at soldiers. 'I don't call that a clash —\\xa0little kids throwing rocks or pebbles against live ammunition,' said an uncle, Hakeem Khalek, said an uncle from New Orleans. 'This all happens overseas, where kids throw rocks at military jeeps. And of course the Israeli army returned fire (and) we're not talking rubber bullets.' US State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki\\xa0expressed hope for a 'speedy and transparent investigation' into the shooting. Youth: Hammad was born in the West Bank, living for a short period in New Orleans before returning to Palestine when we was six . Protests: Palestinian youth were in the streets protesting on Saturday after Hammad was killed as US State Department calls for a 'speedy and transparent investigation' Psaki expressed condolences to the boy's family, and said that US officials will be 'closely engaged with the local authorities, who have the lead on this investigation.' Another US State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that Hammad was a US citizen. Hammad was born in the West Bank territory and spent a year in the US before returning to Palestine with his mother and five siblings. His father is an American citizen with roots in Palestine. 'He wanted Orwah to learn the culture,' said Khalek. 'He really wanted the kids to be brought up in the culture our generation was brought up in.' Khalek said the father was heading to the West Bank after leaving New Orleans Friday evening. Relations have improved little in the West Bank since the August ceasefire between Israel and various Palestinian armed groups. Hammad's death follows the shooting of a 13-year-old eight days ago and 12 other Palestinians were wounded in street clashes with Israeli soldiers on Friday.\",\n",

Fitness instructor Lisa Bratt, 40, collapsed when she suffered a bleed on the brain and a stroke after years of unexplained headaches. Hospital tests revealed her brain was unresponsive so her husband Paul, 38, made the decision to allow doctors to remove her organs. Lisa Bratt (pictured on her wedding day with her husband, Paul) died after collapsing suddenly with a brain haemorrhage and a stroke after suffering from headaches . Part of her liver was donated to a three-year-old boy - allowing him home for the Christmas - and her heart saved the life of a 40-year-old woman from Glasgow. Her lungs, kidneys and the other half of her liver went to save the lives of four more people in Newcastle, Leeds and Liverpool. Mr Bratt, from Hartlepool, said: ‘When I got there she had already gone. I knew that. ‘I had a little bit of hope, but doctors warned me even if she had come through she wouldn't have remembered her life. Mr Bratt agreed to allow his wife's organs to be donated and they have saved six people's lives. The couple are pictured with their sons Michael, 10, and Joshua, nine . ‘I never left her bedside, it was horrible. I'm extremely proud Lisa was able to help others - it's a good thing. ‘Lisa was kind, loving, happy-go-lucky and would do anything for anybody. A brain haemorrhage is bleeding in or around the brain. It can be caused by a head injury but can also happen spontaneously as a result of a ruptured aneurysm. Symptoms include a sudden, very severe headache, vomiting, fits, loss of consciousness and sudden death. A brain haemorrhage is a medical emergency which requires immediate treatment. The two treatment options are using medication to prevent further bleeding, and surgery to repair the source of the bleeding. Haemorrhages most often occur as the result of a brain aneurysm bursting - a brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel's wall. People who smoke, drink heavily, have poorly controlled high blood pressure or who have a family history of aneurysms are most at risk. About 65 per cent of brain haemorrhage patients survive but many find their recovery slow and frustrating. About 9,000 people in the UK have a brain haemorrhage every year. Four out of five patients are aged between 40 and 65. They are more common in women than men. Source: NHS Choices . ‘When we found out she had helped that . little boy go home for Christmas it was overwhelming - I'm tearing up . just thinking about it. ‘She will be there looking down over us . knowing she has helped all these people. That was Lisa - she would do . anything for anyone.’ The newly-qualified fitness trainer was . driving home after dropping her husband off at a work training course . when she was forced to pull over due to an overwhelming headache on . November 18 last year. Screaming in pain, she ran to a nearby friend's house where she collapsed, suffering a bleed on her brain at the same time as a stroke. An ambulance took her to the University Hospital of North Tees, in Stockton, but medics could not bring her back. She was kept clinically alive while doctors took her organs, before pronouncing her dead on November 19. Mr Bratt faced the task of breaking the news to their children - Natasha, 21, Michael, 10, and nine-year-old Joshua. The off-shore platform inspector said: ‘The hardest part was when the boys came in from school on the Tuesday and having to tell them. ‘The boys have taken it all okay and Natasha is doing well at the moment. ‘I have loads of family support and people I work with out in Africa have also come to see me - I've been overwhelmed. ‘She was the best mum the kids could ever wish for, she was the best wife, and she doted on her nephews.’ Mr Bratt will get more details of who his wife helped - and maybe even thank you letters - in the coming year. He also hopes to find out more about why she suddenly collapsed. Part of Mrs Bratt's liver was used to save the life of a three-year-old boy and receiving it enabled him to go home from hospital for Christmas . ‘She was so fit,’ he said. ‘She had just qualified as a fitness instructor, went to the gym every other day and even had a six-pack - she had never been fitter.’ Mrs Bratt’s mother Denise Novak, 60, paid tribute to her eldest child.

The futuristic mode of transport is set to go on sale in Britain soon and this video shows how we could soon all be zipping through the skies. But unfortunately, it's not full-size yet. This hoverbike is only built to a third of the size needed and is actually controlled used a remote. Chris Malloy, the inventor behind the unique design is hoping that he can sell the small prototypes as drones in a bid to fund his dream of creating a version for people to fly. But first he will need to secure an aviation certificate for a manned model. Mr Malloy explained: 'This . drone was originally built as a proof of concept for our latest . full-sized Hoverbike prototype,' said Chris Malloy, the drone's . inventor. 'After . testing the 1/3rd Hoverbike, we realised that it had lots of features . that made it a fantastic drone, not only this - selling this scale . Hoverbike to the public would allow us to raise funds to continue the . development of the manned version. The hoverbike is here! The 1/3 scale version of the bike being piloted by a 3d printed robo-pilot . A mockup of the full sized hoverbike, which the firm hopes to fund by selling the smaller drone version. 'The . objective of this campaign is to kick-start sales of our beautiful . 1/3rd scale Hoverbike drone and accessories via your pledges, and to . help create a long term income stream that we can use to continue . development of the manned Hoverbike.' The drone can reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour, but the full-size model is still under construction. Mr Malloy, of Malloy Aeronautics, . explained: 'When I first got my helicopter licence I realised the . helicopter as a design needs a lot of improvements to be made.' Wanting . to increase reliability and safety, he added: 'Where we strip away . complexity and increase safety, that's where the hoverbike comes from.' The full sized design uses a motorcycle engine and controls. However, the smaller version uses electric motors, and can be controlled using a standard RC helicopter controller. Big screen: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess Leia (Carrie . Fisher) battle a Stormtrooper on their speeder bike in Star Wars Return of the . Jedi . The hoverbike in action - complete with its 3D printed humanoid robot driver. On its Kickstarter page, the company explains: 'We combined the simplicity of a motorbike and the freedom of a helicopter to create the world’s first flying motorcycle. 'When compared with a helicopter, the Hoverbike is cheaper, more rugged and easier to use - and represents a whole new way to fly.\\xa0 The Hoverbike flies like a quadcopter, and can be flown unmanned or manned, while being a safe - low level aerial workhorse with low on-going maintenance. 'We are in the final construction stages of the latest manned prototype of Hoverbike, and in a few months we will start flight testing.The firm says its full sized version could be used to commute on. The futuristic prototype has the potential to travel up to 92 miles or for about 45 minutes on one tank of fuel and is expected to come with a hefty price tag of more than £45,000.\",\n",

A woman spotted what looked like a lizard in a tree near Miller Academy in Thurso in the Highlands yesterday. She alerted the Scottish SPCA, who had to break the news to the concerned caller that it was a cuddly toy which had been nailed to a branch. This photo of a stuffed toy was discovered by a woman and mistaken as being a genuine iguana. It prompted a concerned call to the Scottish SPCA, who were pleased to tell her it was simply a stuffed toy nailed to a tree . Senior inspector Audrey Gunn said: 'The lady was shocked when I told her it wasn’t a real iguana as she thought she’d seen it blink. 'I think someone must have nailed the toy to the tree as a joke and I can see why it fooled her.' The 'iguana' has been taken in by Ms Gunn’s colleague Mandy McIntyre, a reptile enthusiast who works for the charity. The soft toy iguana, which has now been removed, was spotted on a tree near Thurso, Caithness in Scotland . She said: 'It was a nice surprise to find there wasn’t an animal in danger in this case and I must admit it gave Mandy and I a bit of a giggle.

It has the potential to travel up to 92 miles or for about 45 minutes on a single tank of fuel and is expected to cost over £45,000.
