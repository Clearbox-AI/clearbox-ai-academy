# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)

Welcome to the **Fine-Tuning LLM Course**! This repository is your guide to customizing and fine-tuning **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for specific tasks and applications.

## üöÄ What You'll Learn

In this course, you'll learn:

- How to fine-tune **GPT models** using the **OpenAI API** for tailored performance in your applications.  
- How to fine-tune **open-source models** using **Hugging Face** tools and frameworks for specific use cases. 
- Best practices for preparing datasets, optimizing training workflows, and evaluating fine-tuned models.  

Whether you're building a domain-specific chatbot, text generator, or any application powered by an LLM, this course provides the essential building blocks.

## üåü Acknowledgment

The part on fine-tuning open-source LLMs draws inspiration from the **[Hugging Face Smol Courses](https://github.com/huggingface/smol-course/tree/main)**. Huge thanks to the Hugging Face team for their contributions to the open-source AI community! üôå

## üìÅ What's Inside

- **Notebooks** 
  Interactive tutorials to guide you through the fine-tuning process step-by-step.
