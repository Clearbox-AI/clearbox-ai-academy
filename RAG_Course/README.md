# RAG Course with Haystack

Welcome to the **RAG Course**! This folder contains all the resources, tutorials, and examples you need to dive into **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **[Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)**.

## üöÄ What You'll Learn

In this course, you'll discover how to enhance AI models by combining **retrieval systems** with **generative AI** to create powerful, context-aware applications. Whether you're looking to build a question-answering system, a chatbot, or any application requiring dynamic retrieval of external knowledge, this course will get you started.

## üåü Why Haystack?

We use **Haystack**, an open-source framework, for its flexibility and capabilities in building RAG pipelines. With Haystack, you'll learn how to:

- Index and retrieve documents efficiently
- Integrate retrieval with generative models
- Optimize RAG pipelines for real-world use cases

A big thanks to the **Haystack team** for their incredible contributions to the open-source community! üôå
